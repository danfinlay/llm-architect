# `RetrievalQAChain`

The `RetrievalQAChain` is a chain that combines a `Retriever` and a QA chain (described above). It is used to retrieve documents from a `Retriever` and then use a `QA` chain to answer a question based on the retrieved documents.

In the below example, we are using a `VectorStore` as the `Retriever`. By default, the `StuffDocumentsChain` is used as the `QA` chain.
