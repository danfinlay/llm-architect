The improvement I made is:

JavaScript:
```
const exportPiecesBtn = document.getElementById('export-pieces');
const exportBoardsBtn = document.getElementById('export-boards');

exportPiecesBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Code to export custom pieces
});

exportBoardsBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Code to export custom game boards
});

// Added function to export both pieces and boards
function exportCustom() {
  // Code to export custom pieces and boards
}

// Added event listener to export both pieces and boards
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === 'e') {
    exportCustom();
  }
});
```

Explanation: I added a function to export both custom pieces and boards, and an event listener to trigger the export when the user presses the "Ctrl + E" keys. This provides a convenient shortcut for users to quickly export their custom pieces and boards without having to click on the export buttons.
