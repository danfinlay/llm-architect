- The notion of rendering some user-trusted content within the body of an otherwise untrusted context.
- This can be a little hard to imagine, since modern web browsers make this practically impossible, and there are no known examples in the wild.
- Examples
    - Displaying your friends' names instead of an unintelligible identifier on a site in a way that does not allow the website to know what your friends' names are, or to spoof them.
    - Showing times displayed on a website in your local timezone without disclosing your timezone to the website you are visiting.
    - Displaying credibility annotations related to your own social trust graph along with quotations provided in a page's context, in a way that does not allow the page to view your credibility assessments or to spoof them.
- Possible attacks (depending on approach):
    - [[clickjacking]]: A problem if the confinement strategy is with [[iframes]] as in [[Web Amplets]].
        - Would allow a malicious site to intercept clicks intended for trusted UI.
        - Could not redirect those clicks at other areas of the trusted UI.
        - Could make the user think they performed an action when they hadn't.
    - Impersonation
        - A malicious context could render a field as if it were a trusted element, deceiving the user.
            - Example
                - Indicating the user has received funds they have not received.
        - Mitigation
            - [[security pattern]]
