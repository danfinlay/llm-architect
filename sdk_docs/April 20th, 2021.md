- [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]] major version bump is coming
    - Simplifying API surface, removing the `lockdown()` layer and ejecting the [[Static Module Record]] constructor down to a mere duck-type, so a third-party package can take the hit of incorporating [[babel.js]]
        - duck-type is json-serializable which helps keep SES light at runtime.
        - [[Static Module Record]] is only needed at build time, if you need it.
