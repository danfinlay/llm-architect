- The constraints of any UI that manages an extensible system.
    - How do you display permissions content from components that have been added, in a way that they cannot subvert their parent-constraints?
- First, you have a device that you trust.
    - "Seems to work"
    - you don't know anything for sure
- Next, it may want to enable you to extend itself.
- Required properties
    - The extensible environment must be able to render [[trusted UI]].
        - User interface elements that can render in a way that they can appear over all other things in a way that they cannot be invisibly blocked by the thing that they are approving.
- Dangers
    - Showing information from a third party source should be framed as untrusted, or from that source.
    - The untrusted source could display false information and have it interpreted as the current state by the user.
