    - [[federation]]
    - uses [[DNS]]for [[DID]] resolution
        - this stacks two security paradigms, inheriting the attack surface and maintenance of each.
    - has key rotation, but doesn’t seem to have other custom policy methods.
    - uses [[DID]]
        - > At present, none of the DID methods meet our standards fully. Many existing DID networks are permissionless blockchains which achieve the above goals but with relatively poor latency ([ION](https://identity.foundation/ion/)takes roughly 20 minutes for commitment finality). Therefore we have chosen to support [did-web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) and a temporary method we've created called [did-placeholder](https://atproto.com/specs/did-plc). We expect this situation to evolve as new solutions emerge.
