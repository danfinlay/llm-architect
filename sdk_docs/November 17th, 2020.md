- [[endo]] meeting
    - Milestones
        - https://github.com/Agoric/SES-shim/issues/517
        - https://github.com/Agoric/SES-shim/issues/514
    - Was awarded the endo [[npm]] org!
    - Agoric style modules
        - [[JSDoc]] for [[TypeScript]] Types
            - at the package boundary, TypeScript expects to find a types file, but they are not currently building this, and there is maybe a weird interaction related to globals.
        - Using [[ava]] for testing for concurrency and better reporting than [[tape]].
    - [[deno]] seems to have rallied support in the [[yarn]] community including [[Bradley Farias]] and [[Guy Bedford]] to develop a standard way to add explicit authority requests to a JS runtime.
        - Someday you may use [[yarn]] to install an [[endo]] application, and it may be the authority system for granting endo's endowments.
            - There may be other approaches, like using [[pet name]]s for binaries on your system.
            - If you want to grant a binary different authorities by different names
                - You might grant foo access to resources in folder bar.
                    - In [[CapDesk]] you could theoretically install a [[caplet]] multiple times, naming each installation, and endowing [[power/capability]] to individual installations.
    - Should [[endo]] expose platform-specific APIs and scripting and file permissions, or should it try to emphasize exposing a new security model, even if it means eschewing exposing some platform-specific interfaces?
    - [[endo]] is aiming to use [[LavaMoat]] as its inter-module security enforcement for v1.
        - We need to ensure that [[LavaMoat]] suppresses all timing-related APIs by default (unless part of the policy file).
    - Currently there is a tension between the definition of [[Realm]] as defined by [[TC-39]], as it lacks many platform-specific APIs.
        - The terminal experience should be analogous to the devtools: Unify the real-production dev tools with the terminal ones.
    - [[endo]] is the new recipient of the project formerly called [[Dr. SES]]
    - [[Kris Kowal]] initially chose the name [[endo]] when looking for a new name for the [[Compartment Mapper]] he was building, which is now just part of [[endo]] and could also be a dependency of [[LavaMoat]].
    - Need to discuss with [[Moddable SDK]] folks about possibly running [[endo]] on the [[XS Engine]].
    - "We won't have workers, we'll have something more amazing: References to objects in other processes."
        - Today you push apps/deployments to the chain/web.
        - In the future, those may request a deployment from you: Or perhaps maybe they pass you a capability to publish.
        - Scenario
            - a deploy script
            - You pay a service provider for x processes & a load balancer: Each a blank endo environment.
            - You point your DNS at that load balancer
            - In the [[endo]] model, your local deployment script would have references to powers that you want the deployments to have.
            - For each endo, it gets passed its [[power/capability]].
            - On page load, it is going to be a blank endo, and be passed an initial capTp reference to one of the load balanced instances.
    - Questions
        - will this handle [[unwrapping]] of [[membrane]] references?
        - how will updating an endo process work?
            - You create a new [[caplet]] and transfer [[power/capability]] and [[responsibility]] to it.
    - To do
        - It would be very cool to create an executable "power" file format, so you can send someone a power they can store on disk, drag into your wallet, or double click to invoke!
- [[Mark Miller]] shared a [draft link for a blog post](https://medium.com/@erights/5a15a10747b8) called [[A Taxonomy of Security Issues]]
    - Checking its definitions against my own
        - [[integrity]]
            - I had only heard Mark cite in reference to this issue, so the article's definition sounds fine to me.
        - [[availability]]
            - I had only heard Mark cite in reference to this issue, so the article's definition sounds fine to me.
        - [[confidentiality]]
            - [[overt channel]]
                - Perfectly aligns with [my local definition](((TNkAHzNmc))) 
            - [[non-overt channel]]
                - Cuts off abruptly, this definition is much shorter than the one I have locally, but seems like a good summary.
            - [[side channel]]
                - Nicely defined in the article.
            - [[covert-channels]]
                - Nicely defined in the article.
            - [[semi-[[overt channel]]]]
                - Not addressed in the article, but is an interesting point on [WeakRef
            - [[anthropic [[side channel]]]]
                - Not addressed in the article, and is probably out of scope.
    - Key notes
        - "It is much easier to defend against side channels than defend against covert channels."
            - On first read I have to think a bit about why. I might add "because a covert channel implies the leaker is actively trying to leak" or something.
