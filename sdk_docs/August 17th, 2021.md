    - [[Dan Connolly]] prompt: Can we define our object capabilitiy guarantees as part of the article?
        - Ocaps are supposed to keep "action at a distance" easy to review, and it'd be nice to see that in our security reports.
            - Should we then suggest that Ocap make SES easier to review?
        - [[Mark Miller]]: ocaps fall between memory safe imperative programming and pure functional programming:
            - [[functional programming]] has extreme locality of lexical scope with no side effects, but at the cost of side effects.
            - Memory safe [[imperative programming]] benefits from side effects, but makes it hard to reason about side effects.
            - [[object capability (ocap)]] programming allows you to reason about things in terms of what powers they have been granted, allowing you to reason about what side effects are possible.
        - [[Mark Miller]] goes into the security guarantees of [[object capability (ocap)]] programming in [[Automated Analysis of Security Critical JavaScript]]
        - How are we confident of these security properties?
            - The only reason [[Mark Miller]] is confident is that he was a diligent guardian at [[TC-39]].
            - [[Yulia Startsev]] has proposed an effort to write down the [[TC-39]] invariants, and include them in the spec in a [[normative]] manner, giving them the same status as anything else in the spec, and so if anything violates the invariants, it will mean the spec is in an inconsistent state.
            - "All primordials" API may come to pass!
        - Invariants
            - Via the initial primordials, there is no hidden state outside of Date, Math.random(), and Locale.
        - Actualities that are not formal invariants
            - There is nothing we cannot remove
            - An implementation may add new syntax that we cannot defend against.
                - This forces the [[ses-shim]] to update as new vectors are discovered.
                - [[E for X]] was an example
                - No implementation has done this in about a decade without proposing before TC-39.
    - [[Jessy Irwin]] is helping edit the [[[[ses-shim]] red team]] report
        - An audit isn't just about highlighting what's wrong, it's also about highlighting and emphasizing what is right about the way it's created.
    - Topics to possibly raise
        - [[[[Access Control List (ACL)]] vs [[object capability (ocap)]]]] thread
        - Throwback to [[Kumavis]]'s talk about "common goods" contracts: Is [[Zoe]] such a public goods contract suite?
    - Action items
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Add a section to red team report about positive observations: Usually a red-team report is "are common mistakes being made here?", so we can acknowledge that obvious mistakes are not being made. Are there areas where we feel classes of vulnerabilities have been avoided?
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Add to red team report to help emphasize "how hard it was to secure [[JavaScript]]", to help argue for an easier to reason about language for [[TG3]]
            - Ensure the language does not break the achievement of this confinement.
            - Integrate this shim into the language so the shim is not needed.
