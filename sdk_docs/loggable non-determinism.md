- Loggable non-determinism means that the only sources of non-determinism were powers --- ocaps that were not provided by default, like I/O, [[WeakRef]], and sources of duration. If Bob runs as code confined by Alice, then Alice is in a position to log all inputs to Bob such that Bob cannot escape deterministic replay. Bob can't tell if this is the first time he's running and receiving live inputs, or being replayed from logged inputs. [[SwingSet]] treats [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]] as a language with only loggable non-determinism and replays vats on that basis. See https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/1852 for some example issues that arise.
- So [[loggable non-determinism]] both enables replication and replay needed for chains, but also closes off the possibility of other non-overt channels. The logged inputs may still contain overt subliminal channels, such as stegonography in the low order bits of jpg images. But Alice only needs to worry about these in inputs she chose to provide.
