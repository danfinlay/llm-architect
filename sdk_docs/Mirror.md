    - Auctioning off an NFT in an article

            - pros
            - cons
                - Disincentivizes sharing an article you enjoyed if you are bidding on its NFT.
                - Single price auction can throw 
        - Could be a good candidate for [[MATT: An [[NFT]] Auction Concept]]
            - Author is able to distribute many NFTs instead of just one.
            - Many buyers can win.
            - Inviting people can only lower the cost of a current bidder gaining the NFT, incentivizing recommendations.
                - For "trophy case" type NFT collectors, exclusivity isn't as important as being able to express personal preference while supporting artists directly.
            - Additional bidders can only increase the artist's total revenue.
            - Author can close the auction at any time.
                - Waiting too long could lead to bidders closing their bids
                - Leaving bids open can be a sort of shared [[credit line]] between the bidder and the artist, where all parties retain the full rights to the bid should they need it.
                    - Wallets could show this "winning bid" similar to an NFT, allowing "perpetually winning bids" to be a kind of [[social collateral]] lite, teaching people about [[mutual credit]].
