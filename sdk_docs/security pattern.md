- A visual security mechanism, for establishing familiarity, and ideally helping users identify appropriate concerns.
- Properties
    - consistent (whenever it is seen, it appears the same)
    - visually distinct (it appears distinct to other things)
    - personally distinct (a user recognizes their unique holding from someone elseâ€™s representation of that token)
    - impactfully memorable (when it varies, it ideally raises alarm).
- Most often seen as [[identicons]], but there are other variations:
    - [[security images]]
    - [[Mark Miller]] suggests [[security tartan]] for backgrounds.
    - [[jazzicon]]
- Effectiveness?
    - A [[Carnegie Mellon]] study found 75% of users would still enter a password even if the security image changed.

    - Maybe this is one of those times where [[only good design can test this theory]].
        - Requirements
            - Designer must be able to procedurally generate their design: Given a very large number (like a UUID), they should be able to produce a visual artifact matching the Properties.
        - Unique open-endedness
            - This visual element may be useful in a wide variety of contexts:
                - The background of a page
                - An icon representing an item
                - A frame surrounding a view
                - A pattern of unique capitalization in [a word](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/55)
