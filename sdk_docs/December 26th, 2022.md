- [[Lane Rettig]] declares [[proof of humanity]] is impossible without violating one of (scalable, permissionless, decentralized)
    - [the tweet](https://twitter.com/lrettig/status/1607253618327195648?s=20&t=mj67kvDWuAzgfT55lDm2hA)
    - My take
        - [[decentralized [[identity]]]] and [[proof of humanity]] are indeed often solutions being pursued because other solutions require them as axioms, like [[quadratic voting]].
        - There are indeed hard constraints around any identity system which makes me pretty reflexively avoid them, because I see that systems like [[digital [[social collateral]]]] satisfy the goals of such systems but while avoiding the pitfalls.
        - I'm not sure the three characteristics I would name are decentralized, scalable, and permissionless. In part because I'm not sure decentralized or scalable are adequately defined in Lane's tweet.
        - Let me list some of the pitfalls of decentralized identity systems, I'll even lump them into those three categories as proposed definitions when it makes sense:
            - Decentralized
                - A single consistent view of the group's membership is neither desirable nor possible
                    - Nazis would declare Jews to not be human, and other racists might also draw the line in ways one might disagree with.
                    - We may someday want to incorporate additional sentient beings into our society. Is humanity really even the right bar to hold things to?
                        - Apes
                        - Dolphins
                        - Octopi
                        - Crows
                        - artifical intelligences
                        - Aliens
                    - A single entity should not just mean a single agent, but even in the [[convergent decentralization]] sense of the term: A single dispute resolution process like is used in [[Proof of Humanity Protocol (PoHP)]] would still mean that a single definition must be globally agreed to.
                - Scalable
                    - For purposes of scalability, it must be possible for people to participate in proposed social systems even if they are not connected to the network
                        - Over great distances (like where light becomes an obstacle)
                        - Over limited network connectivity
                        - With other individuals who mutually acknowledge each others' value, but who are socially disconnected from previous assemblages of agents.
                - Permissionless
                    - People should be able to begin to participate even without a single person vouching for them. This can include by them vouching for others.
