- A group of [[Ethereum]] proposals that aim to create a path to dethroning the [[externally owned account (EOA)]], by whatever means are agreeable to the community.
- Motivations
    - Today Ethereum account security is horrendously flawed.
        - Most users are using EOAs.
        - You cannot update the security model of an EOA.
        - Some assets cannot be transferred, so there is no way for a key to be invalidated or rotated.
        - Some DeFi positions can incur penalties to withdraw.
        - Transferring assets is gas expensive
            - Especially for long time users who could have many tokens wrapped within protocols multiple times.
        - Keeping an account alive over time has benefits
            - Being available for airdrops based on past behavior.
        - The amount of value held by these accounts across all chains is enormous, and we should make improving security affordable.
        - Delegation without revocation is the original sin of the protocol.
            - Users accumulate outstanding signatures and information leakage and have no way to fundamentally establish a clean break for the future of their accounts.
    - Today, proposals for revising the account model are frequently mired under the extremely complicated topic of [[account abstraction (AA)]]. We do not want to get bogged down into trying to perfect AA as part of addressing all of these substantial security issues.
        - The below proposals do not provide the path off of ECDSA and the current EOA model as the entry-point for EVM-initiating transactions.
        - The below proposals do not introduce new ways of paying gas.
        - The below proposals do not introduce new nonce / tx uniqueness methods at the protocol layer.
        - The below proposals do not introduce a way to perform non-revertable state updates.
        - The below proposals do not affect the validation of pending transactions.
        - The below proposals do not 
    - We should provide paths for users to choose security models that better meet their individual needs.
- Introduction to the proposals
    - We have sorted the proposals into two categories
        - Methods of updating an account's authorization pattern
        - Methods of allowing the above methods to work for accounts without gas
    - By adopting at least one proposal from the first category, all EOAs would have a low-gas path to updating their security policy.
    - By adopting at least one of the proposals from each of these categories, we will be able to allow all EOAs to upgrade their security model, with or without gas to pay for the transaction, making efficient key rotation available to any EOA, even those that hold no ether.
    - Some of these proposals include much greater long-term flexibility, but we have provided the spectrum of options so that a simplest agreeable path forward can be found and acted on.
- Proposals
    - Methods of updating an account's auth pattern
        - [[SELF_USURP]]
            - EOA => Contract, one way.
            - Could emulate simple key rotation.
                - You could publish a contract at an EOA's address that will forward messages sent to it matching its own arbitrary criteria.
        - [[KEY_ROTATE]]
            - A pure key-rotation scheme: Just assigning a different key to control an EOA.
        - [[ADDCODE]]
            - EOA += Contract,  retaining EOA.
    - Methods of allowing the above methods to work for accounts without gas
        - [[Yoav Weiss (yoavw)]]'s [[simpler [[[[EIP]] 3074: Delegated Invocation Contracts]]]]
            - A method that allows a contract account to forward batches of transactions on an EOA's behalf.
            - It would still increment the user's nonce, and only be able to send messages that were each signed by the original EOA key.
            - Designed to avoid perceived dangers that come from the versatility of 3074, this version can only support batches of transactions.
        - [[[[EIP]] 3074: Delegated Invocation Contracts]]
            - A hugely flexible approach that allows signing messages that allow any number of other contracts to initiate transactions on behalf of the signer's account.
            - Benefits over the simpler proposal below
                - The user could perform their delegation to a new policy without submitting that message on chain.
                - The order of the user's delegation messages is not enforced, and so users could sign a revocation message that they keep on a lower-security device for usage in a moment of panic.
- Language & definitions
    - Account recovery / key rotation
        - Changing the key that controls the account to a new one. The original key no longer works.
