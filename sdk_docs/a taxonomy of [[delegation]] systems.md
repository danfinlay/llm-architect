- A major theme of this graph [[Capabul]] is become digital delegation, because it enables patterns of collaboration that are rarely seen on the web today, and could provide alternative economic modes (see [[digital [[social collateral]]]]).
- Since I began writing it, decentralized delegation schemes have been becoming more popular, but they tend to vary in a specific number of ways. I'm beginning this page to start to list out the major genes that make up a delegation system.
- Delegation genes
    - Enforcement mode
        - enforced by a the content host
            - [[macaroon]]
            - [[User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN)]]
        - enforced by the interpreting client
            - [[Delegatable Eth]] with [[Laconic]]
        - enforced by some [[coordinated decentralization]] system like a [[blockchain]]
            - [[Delegatable Eth]]
            - [[Delegate.cash]]
    - Accountability mechanism
        - [[swiss number]] style access key sharing
        - Per-role invitation link or [[macaroon]]
        - Chained signatures
            - [[zcap-ld]]
            - [[Delegatable Eth]]
            - [[User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN)]]
    - Engforcement mode dynamism
        - Can new enforcement modes be added at runtime without a coordinated update with all involved parties?
        - yes
            - [[evm]]
            - [[SwingSet]]
        - no
            - [[User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN)]]
