- The process of [[arbitration]] reacting to misuse of some [[power/capability]] in a situation where the power misused was delegated based on the [[collateral]] of the issuer's relationship with the receiver, in which there may be compensation, resent, or forgiveness.

- Is easy to describe for smaller scenarios, but can actually be performed by connecting graph of arbitrary size and complexity, and this is increasingly feasible due to digital technology. (See [[digital [[social collateral]]]])
- In practice, all people are connected by [[three and a half degrees of separation]], and so there is probably a practical upper bound on the size that this dance would ever need to grow to.
- There are actually many variations of protocols for resolving disputes in such a system. Some variations includw
    - Pre approval per expense or not
    - Retroactive review of usage or not
        - Retroactive approval/forgiveness can refresh a line of credit.
    - Negotiating new terms/expectations upon disappointment.
        - Can include instructions to reduce allocations to a given delegate. Per [[Hortonâ€™s Who Done It?]]
- Examples
    - Two person example
        - {{mermaid}}
            - graph TD;
                - Alice -- Car --> Bob
        - Alice lends Bob her car
        - Bob gets in a car wreck
        - Alice can either
            - Forgive: Accept that the accident was not Bob's fault, and take the loss.
            - Resent: Blame Bob for the accident, and be less willing to risk things with him again.
            - A hybrid of the above
    - Three person example
        - {{mermaid}}
            - graph TD;
                - Alice -- Car --> Bob
                - Bob -- Car --> Carol
        - Alice lends Bob her car
        - Bob lends Alice's car to Carol
        - Carol gets the car in a wreck
        - Bob can either
            - Forgive and accept loss: Accept that the accident was not Carol's fault, and take the loss by replacing Alice's car. This leaves Alice content.
            - Forgive and forward loss: Insist that the accident was not Carol's fault, and explain this situation to Alice, for her consideration.
                - Alice can either
                    - Forgive: Accept that the accident was not Bob's fault, and take the loss.
                    - Resent: Blame Bob for the accident, and be less willing to risk things with him again.
                    - A hybrid of the above
            - Resent and accept loss: Blame Carol for the accident, but replace Alice's car to avoid being subject to judgment.
            - Resent and forward loss: Blame Carol for the accident (being less likely to lend her things in the future), but apologize to Alice for the loss.
                - Alice can either
                    - Forgive: Accept that the accident was not Bob's fault, and take the loss.
                    - Resent: Blame Bob for the accident, and be less willing to risk things with him again.
