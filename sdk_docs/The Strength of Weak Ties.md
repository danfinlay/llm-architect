- A paper by [[Mark Granovetter]]
- From Wikipedia
    - Granovetter's paper "The Strength of Weak Ties" is a highly influential 
research paper, with about 50,000 citations according to Google Scholar 
(as of November 2018).  Its thesis is that weak ties -- 
acquaintanceships that are not reinforced by many mutual friendships -- 
are especially pivotal in the flow of information.  It has become a core
 idea in the field of social networks. In marketing, information 
science, or politics, weak ties enable reaching populations and 
audiences that are not accessible via strong ties. The concepts and 
findings of this work were later published in the monograph __Getting A Job__, an adaptation of Granovetter's doctoral dissertation at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University)'s
 Department of Social Relations, with the title: "Changing Jobs: 
Channels of Mobility Information in a Suburban Population" (313 pages).
- A concept in social graph theory that suggests that weak, casual relationships play an important role in social networks.
- more novel information flows to individuals through weak rather than strong ties. Because our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, the information they receive overlaps considerably with what we already know. Acquaintances, by contrast, know people that we do not, and thus receive more novel information.

        - specific findings from [[Trust and social collateral: 2009 (Karlan, Mobius, Rosenblat, Szeidl)]]

        - The resources that are most scarce in our own groups are likely scarce for all members, but may be different than the resource availability in another group.
    - [[arbitrage]]
        - By connecting two economies, an arbitrageur is able to create profit because they are able to make scarce resources available in two contexts simultaneously (by facilitating trade).
