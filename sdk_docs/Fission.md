- What is [[Fission]]?
    - Taking a bunch of web3 tools and making them useful for any web dev.
    - "fast app publishing".
        - Not just for devs, but any "makers".
    - A set of tools
        - You register a subdomain `${name}.fission.app`.
            - Randomly assigned `delicious-green-princess`.
        - Install a local ipfs node
        - use ipfs to publish
        - update the DNS link and store files for you.
        - If you run the ipfs node, it does help host your site.
        - They call this [[WebNative]]
            - Manages login, files, database, encryption, revisions, and more built in.
        - Soon: App cloning, to empower even more digital makers - from front end devs to end user customization.
            - Clone any Fission site, customize & edit it.
            - This might tie into their update strategy.
            - Could allow users to opt into earlier versions.
    - Building on [[IPFS]] as a key enabling technology.
        - Asking users to do this used to be a pain, so they now automatically install & run it.
    - Developed [[Web Native File System (WNFS)]] to add encrypted file capabilities & permissions.
    - [[User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN)]] brings decentralized auth: Built on [[DID]]s
    - "Must work in all browsers, including mobile, with no extensions"
    - Normalize paying for apps/sites.
    - Aiming entirely for [[w3c]] inclusion.
    - Aiming for the UX of [[iCloud]].
