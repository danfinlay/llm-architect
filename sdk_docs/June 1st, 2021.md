    - How is [[dynamic import]] different from a function call?
        - [[direct eval]] is very different because it uses the [[lexical scope]] of the code itself, like any other special form (with/while blocks).
        - [[dynamic import]] expression is much more __like__ a function call.
            - "In retrospect, it should have been a function call" to a name in lexical scope - [[Mark Miller]]
            - The funny thing about dynamic import semantics is that it's relative to the module that it's in as a referrer.
        - Does the parser need to treat [[eval]] as different from any other JS function call?
            - The parser does need to identify if it's a [[direct eval]], so it should be a different [[abstract syntax tree (AST)]] type from a function call.
            - However, many common parsers today like [[babel.js]] probably don't enforce this at all!
        - [[babel.js]] optimizer danger according to [[Mark Miller]]
            - What it does 
                - Has to climb the AST, and ask "does this node that is flagged as a function call happen to fall into the pattern that characterizes the [[direct eval]] expression"?
            - why it's a terrible idea
                - If someone inserts a lightweight optimizer that sees things like `(1, eval)(‘console.log(“hi”))` might see that the expression that is invoking the function is a common expression with a do-nothing left side and a lexical right side, might default to the lexical right side ( `eval('console.log("hi")')`), which would cause the pattern recognizer below to interpret this as a [[direct eval]], which would be wrong.
                    - That one comma conveys that this subsequent call is not a [[direct eval]] expression.
    - a re-exporter cannot tell if the original exporter is exporting something live or not, so any re-exported module must be treated as a possible [[live binding]].
    - `export *` got past [[TC-39]], but at least it's not as bad as `import *`, which pollutes the local namespace unpredictably.
