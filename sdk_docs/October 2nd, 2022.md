    - Scenarios
        - EOA delegating rights but not gas
            - Can already be done with Delegatable today.
        - EOA invoking own right with delegated gas
            - Requires either
                - a trusting relay
                - some kind of gas relay that is not grief prone
        - EOA invoking others' right with delegated gas
            - Requires either
                - a trusting relay
                - some kind of gas relay that is not grief prone
            - Seems the most complex to manage with a grief-resistant relay, so if we can model it, we should be able to do the others.
                - Setup
                    - Alice (iWallet) delegates Bob (EOA) the right to redeem an NFT.
                    - Carol (iWallet, with ether) delegates Bob the right to spend up to 1 ether.
                    - Bob wants to initiate the redemption of his NFT from Alice with  
                - Structure of the invocation
                    - 4337 UserOp/Invocation
                        - to: NFT contract
                        - data: redeem()
                        - gas payor: SomeNewObjectType
                            - Delegation[]
                                - 
                        - Other params irrelevant to this example: gas limit, gas price
