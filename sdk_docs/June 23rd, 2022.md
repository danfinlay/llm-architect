- [[Scheme]] [tutorial](https://dustycloud.org/tmp/spritely-whitepaper-previews/spritely-core.html#scheme-tutorial) in the [[Spritely]] docs by [[Christine Lemmer Webber]]
    - Supposedly can allow a non-programmer to learn to make a Scheme interpreter in Scheme in an hour!
        - Makes me want to implement Scheme in [[Jessie]]
    - Notes
        - Claims to use [[Wisp ([[Lisp]] syntax)]] but then quickly drops it.
        - I kinda wish Scheme didn't have the multiple `define` syntax sugars for lambdas! I really do crave a minimal-syntax language, even if it means some extra typing sometimes.
