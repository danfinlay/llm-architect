- An idea for how to run a cooperative that I came up with when trying to devise how I'd like the [[MetaMask]] company to operate (if it were its own business).
- Meets a variety of high standards
    - Early employees/investors should have a diminishing stake if not actively contributing.
    - Diligent contributors should be able to work their way up to any level of ownership.
    - Maximize how much ownership employees have access to. Always strive to [[exit to community]]
    - Employees should have say in who funds the business.
    - Employees should be able to be paid in whatever currencies they most prefer.
    - Employees are incentivized to preserve the share value.
    - Employees are incentivized to participate in fundraising.
- After [some earlier drafts]([[Share Proposal B]]), I landed on a solution that is [[so simple it sounds dumb]]
    - The organization pays everyone in its own shares.
    - Funders can make offers for shares in any currency or group of currencies, making it a [[multi dimensional [[auction]]]].
    - Employees can choose to keep or sell as much as they care to.
- The original major document on this was lost somehow.
    - The body of a hasty partial attempted re-write
        - # MetaMask Share Proposal “C”
            - This document will outline a design for a type of fundraising and revenue distribution mechanism that could be used by any organization, but designed intended for use by the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet as currently funded by ConsenSys.
        - ## The Goals
            - MetaMask aspires to be the wallet of the future: A low cost but highly useful utility that enables anyone to participate in crypto economies.
            - In order to be the most competitive wallet, we must both provide the best services, and maintain the leanest overhead possible. This has driven us to pursue a model that both allows a very open-ended type of fundraising with a clear path to profit for our investors, but also a clearly defined path for the MetaMask team to work towards employee-ownership if they are willing to commit to consistently reinvesting in the project themselves.
            - This work builds on and extends concepts from [continuous organizations](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/), but eschews the notion of a public market for shares, and instead prioritizes the team member’s ability to select their sources of funding, with the goals of selecting for alignment between investor and builder, and promoting employee diversification into the currencies that are useful to them.
        - ## The Design
        - ### Funding Acceptance and Share Issuance
            - First, initial shares will be distributed according to an approximation of “if these rules had existed for our history”.
            - Every employee’s pay rate is defined in team tokens. When they do work, they receive those tokens.
            - Funders have the ability to post purchase orders for team tokens. Team members who require immediate liquidity can sell for those funds, and team members who can afford to and want to bet on the future success of that token can hold them.
            - Revenue is added to a pool that any token holder can claim a fraction of proportional to the number of tokens they deposit.
        - ## Properties
            - This design has pretty much all the desired properties of Share Proposal B, but with a much simpler design.
                - Contributors are empowered to select the funders they prefer to hold shares.
                - Contributors are empowered to accept whatever compensation they are willing to value in exchange for their allocated shares.
                - Since shares are continually issued, there is limited bias for early contributions. This can be adjusted by adjusting the rate of issuance over time, but by default a flat distribution would value all contributions equally, and facilitate a very healthy long-living project.
