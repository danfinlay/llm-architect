- A personal logical machine that is used for maintaining a personal set of data (medical, personal, private, etc) and logic around it.
- When you turn it off, nobody else can access it by any means.
- Would allow you to specify your own arbitrary sharing policy.
- Might build on [[zero-knowledge proofs]] like [[garbled circuit]]s.
    - Maybe computes on the metadata instead of the whole data.
- Addresses problems with the modern web
    - Private mode on modern browsers is leaky
        - Still does DNS lookups
        - Calculates JS, and may interact with your swap file.
- Reminds me of
    - [[urbit]]
    - [[SwingSet]]
