- Still needs a better name.
- A form of [[[[Ethereum]] [[object capability (ocap)]]]] [[contract account]], enabling a form of [[digital [[social collateral]]]].
    - Intended to be building on [[[[[[Gnosis]] SAFE]] [[object capability (ocap)]]]] but introducing support for [[counterfactual]] capabilities, but without the complexity of the optionally stateless, self-deallocating [[Counterfactual WebCap Wallet]] concept.
- May be just about composable today from the [[any.sender]] contract account.
- Requirements from a base [[contract account]]
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Supports MetaTransactions
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Supports [[[[[[Gnosis]] SAFE]] module]]s
    - {{[[DONE]]}} Needs to support counterfactual publication via [[[[EIP]] 1014: CREATE2]]
        - A message that can be submitted to publish a contract at a known address at any time by anyone, or can be invalidated.
            - [[multi-nonce]] could be a way to natively support message invalidation without any further complexity.
                - For each delegation, a different nonce[n] could be used. The first message, at nonce[n][0] could be the message that adds the module permission itself. This way, a single message invalidating that message would prevent all authority from being granted to the rest of the message/delegation branch.
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Support [[multi-nonce]] like order-independent transaction submission.
    - Nice to haves
        - {{[[TODO]]}} Support batched MetaTransactions
- Acceptance criteria
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Ability to compose a [[MetaTransaction]] to publish a [[gnosis safe attenuator]]
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Ability to compose a [[MetaTransaction]] to publish an additional [[Stateless SAFE Cap]]
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Once the above two are possible, it will be trivial to create a message which “delegates a limited action to a new account controlled by a key that is included in the message”, effectively creating an off-chain permission to use the specified [[power/capability]].
        - At that point, the development of increasingly sophisticated [[gnosis safe attenuator]]s will be of critical importance.
        - There is also then a question of how a wallet represents the permission they now have: A dissolution of the conflation of “account” and [[authority]]: While an account may be the root of this authority, ultimately the authority itself is what a user will be most likely to care about and interact with.
- Some showcases that could catch eyes
    - Delegating a vote in a democracy that was not designed with delegation in mind.
    - Sharing allowances, recursively.
    - Sharing a [[MetaTransaction]] gas-limit allowance, which allows invited people to invite additional people.
    - Creating [[incentive trees]] around the sale of a finite resource. 
        - Incentive tree use case examples
            - Selling tickets to an exclusive event, like [[Burning Man]]:
                - You add a commission to each friend you invite, and thus can set your commission according to how badly you want that person to have access, or what you’d want to be paid for them to get access.
            - Creating a [[0x Protocol]] style relay system except that it supports arbitrarily deep tries of aggregators.
            - Buying shares of a vacation house, or a retreat, or a [[Community Supported Agriculture  (CSA)]]
                - Rather than having a fully public market, you have a market where each sale and each price increase is intimately connected to the recipient of the opportunity.
- Benefits of being [[counterfactual]]
    - Eliminated transaction fees for any [[object capability (ocap)]] not exercised.
    - Improved privacy until the point of exercise.
    - If combined with [[Will-o-wisps]] style self-termination, stateless capabilities can avoid requiring any state on-chain, as explored in [[Counterfactual WebCap Wallet]].
