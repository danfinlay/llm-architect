- If Alice inadvertently leaks information to Bob in a way that is not an [[overt channel]] of the system, this is a side channel.
- Non-overt channels divide into [[side channel]] or [[covert-channels]] based only on the intention of the code or agent emitting the information. If Alice intended to leak the information to Bob, it is a covert channel. If Alice was coded with no such intention, then it is a side channel. It is much easier to defend against side channels than defend against covert channels. It is no easier to be invulnerable to side channels than covert channels. Seems paradoxical. By "defend" I mean imperfectly. By "invulnerable" I mean perfectly. Any misbehavior that Alice might engage in intentionally, she may engage in innocently. The probability distributions differ, but not the line between possible and impossible.
