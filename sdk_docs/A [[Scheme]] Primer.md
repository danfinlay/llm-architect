- My Questions
    - do lib macros collide? ie if I import a macro, could it corrupt the namespace that my own macros are defined within, potentially enabling things like an escape from a sandbox I import?
    - I'm confused by the `...` in the `make-syntax-rule`:
        - I would think calling `(begin body ...)` would result in something like
            - user enters `(when true (thing1 thing2) spare-arg)`
            - program unpacks to `((thing1 thing2) spare-arg)`
            - Is that right?
