- [[[[Multiple Network Connection]] API]]
    - [[service tag based discovery]]
        - Imagine a [[secure extensible permission system]] has a "service registry", where any plugin can register a method by service tag string.
            - Examples
                - `eip:155:1:eth_accounts` to request an account on chainId 1
                - `eip155:1:eth` for reads
        - Each service tag needs a human readable description that can be presented to the user.
