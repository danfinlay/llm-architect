- A style of key generation first used by [[3box]]
    - Also used by [[Loopring]]
- The technique of asking a user to sign a message and using the resulting signature as a private key for a cryptographic protocol.
- Example signature challenge:
    - `Do you trust this site to update and decrypt your 3box profile?` 
    - As long as a portion of the message is coherent and readable, even with a nonce appended, 
- Security properties
    - Lets the application implement its own crypto, allowing alternative cryptography.
    - Can be restored with the user's pre-existing recovery method.
    - Is not as easy to "roll-forward"?
