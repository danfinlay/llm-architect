- Object based
    - Aka [[object capability (ocap)]] pattern.
    - Avoid [[confused deputy]] problem
    - No more passing identifiers as parameters
        - no `sendTransaction(fromAddress, toWhom)`. Instead `account1.sendTo(account2)`.
    - This grows in importance with [[[[MetaMask]] Snaps]] system, since they allow a [[dependency]] graph to grow, and the confused deputy problem specifically becomes an issue when you have >2 cooperating agents in a system.
- Distributed references
    - Using [[CapTP]]
        - I know, the [[Eventual Send]] operator can be off-putting. Maybe we create a version that avoids that, more like [[Capnode]], for the sake of adoption. We would lose [[Promise Pipelining]], but would still get some of the most important parts.
- Assets are passed to other agents like [[dapp]]s as object references which hold all the methods that the asset permission is meant to imbue.
    - [[programming with [[object capability (ocap)]] style]]
- Simplest possible interface
    - What is the get/put (aws) of a wallet?
    - Possibility
        - putAsset
            - The [[[[EIP]] 747: wallet_watchAsset]] approach
                - Leans on our default knowledge of [[Ethereum]] and [[ERC-20]] and other common-enough-to-be-default standards.
            - A permissionless extensibility approach
                - `wallet_addSnap` would be like this, except snaps are currently based on string identifiers, and so the [[confused deputy]] problem, rather than being objects that can be passed to √êapps.
            - What is the shape of an asset? What is the interface one must expose to "the wallet?"
                - The snap approach
                    - Include a script that knows how to request needed permissions and provide the needed interface.
                - The backwards-compatible 
        - getAsset
