- A type of [[NFT]] [[auction]] from [[FeralFile]]
- https://feralfile.com/docs/faq#group-auction
- Similar to a [[MATT: An [[NFT]] Auction Concept]]
    - differences
        - a fixed number of items to sell
        - no revoking an outstanding bid
        - they've chosen to do a [[semi-open-bid]] where bids are closed but they share hints to bidders about the state of the bids
            - Floor Bid. The lowest bid that is currently winning an edition of the artwork.
                - In a [[MATT: An [[NFT]] Auction Concept]], if this information is available, then bidders are able to "win" by bidding just under this price and increasing the number of editions (and reducing the sale price) but without increasing the total money raised for the artist.
            - Median Bid. The middle bid for the artwork: half of the bids are lower and half are higher.
            - Highest Bid. The highest current bid for the artwork.
