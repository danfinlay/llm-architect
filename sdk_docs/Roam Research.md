- This notes site!
- How I got here
    - I was an avid note taker, mostly using iOS notes.
    - I loved the all-notes search, and felt it did everything I could need.
    - I started realizing I was keeping lots of nested bullet points in my notes.
    - I realized I wanted the bullet points to go arbitrarily deep, and to double as a task management system.
    - I eventually discovered [[Workflowy]], which is a beautiful application, and used it for work for ~1.5-2 years.
    - Workflowy became frustrating at times because I would always have to find where to write a note, and sometimes a note felt like it belonged in two places.
    - Once I saw Roam, I could see it was basically Workflowy but with context-independent blocks that could be stitched together from anywhere.
