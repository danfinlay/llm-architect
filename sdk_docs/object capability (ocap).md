    - http://cap-lore.com/CapTheory/
- A model of language-level computer security in which
    - No agent receives any [[power/capability]] by default.
    - All [[power/capability]] is granted through explicit and deliberate means.
    - All [[power/capability]] can be intrinsically delegated and attenuated, recursively.
    - A reference to a [[power/capability]] cannot be forged.
- This model has been proven to be a more flexible superset of the more popular [[access-control security]] model.
- Example
    - `dave.wash(onlyDrive(car))`
- Ways to describe [[object capability (ocap)]]
    - Some by [[Dean Tribble]]
        - A security model that is used by some of the most secure systems in the world.
        - Simply builds out of the object-oriented programming style that most programmers already know how to do.
    - Programmers often today snark on [[object oriented programming]]. How to address that.
        - Usually not for [[encapsulation]] of state, which is the part we are trying to convey.
        - Usually for [[inheritance]] reasons, which is not required for [[object capability (ocap)]].
        - "This is object capabilities, not object __oriented__ capabilities."

    - how to upgrade
        - Approaches
            - Replace the script in place, with the same capability graph?
            - Create a new [[caplet]], and migrate [[capability]] to the new one.
    - failure-masking vs failure apparent systems

- Challenges communicating these ideas
    - It can appear too simple
        - People then try adding concepts on top to build comfort for themselves.
    - If you innovate in security and it fails, people blame you, but "[[nobody ever got fired for buying IBM]]"
    - Often is sold as a security paradigm, but nobody cares about security until it's too late.
