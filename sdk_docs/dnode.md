- [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dnode)
- A callback-based RPC module by [[substack]] that is somehow still rock-solid to this day despite being barely maintained, and has been in [[MetaMask]] since its first versions.
    - dnode is an asynchronous [[rpc]] system for [[Node.js]] that lets you
call remote functions.
    - You can pass callbacks to remote functions, and the remote end can call
the functions you passed in with callbacks of its own and so on.
It's callbacks all the way down!
