- This song caught my ear and evoked a chain of [[social collateral]] being enforced.
    - Evil is a relay sport
    - When the one who's burnt
    - Turns to pass the torch
- The song wasn't really meant to represent this, it was more written to represent a cycle of abuse, but it can also represent a long chain of social endorsement bubbling up to enforce against a wrong claim.
