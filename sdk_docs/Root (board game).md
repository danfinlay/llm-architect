- Lizard cult strategy
    - Weaknesses
        - No movement capability
        - Inflexibility of tactical attacks across map
        - Dependent on hand cards
            - Lizards definitely can do nothing if the cards aren't right
            - If the lost souls discard pile does not work out perfectly for the lizards, they will spend the entire turns without being able to move or attack or do anything
    - Strengths
        - Gardens are relatively easy to create, making crafting particularly easy.
    - David's intro to Lizards
        - Low reach high aggression faction. Starts in one of the 4 corners with a Garden.  Troops around the garden and in adjacent spaces.  Gardens are your only building and Lizards ALWAYS rule any clearing where there is a Garden, regardless of how many enemy troops are there.

When a Lizard is in the game, they hijack discarded cards.  During your turn and other people's turns, any discarded cards do NOT go to the discard, they go to your player board under the "Lost Souls" space.  Then first thing during Birdsong on your turn, you count up the # of each suit in the Lost Souls.  The suite with the most cards becomes the new "Outcast suit".  The outcast suit affects what suit clearings you can perform abilitites in.  If there's a tie between # of cards in the Lost Souls deck, or if the winner is the same suit as already is the Outcast suit, the Outcast suit becomes "Hated" --- meaning it's the MEGA OUTCAST SUIT (further affects your abilities).

At this point all the Lost Souls go to the REAL discard.  So essentially it delays cards going to the discard pile by one full turn rotation.

Next important item, is when your warriors die, they don't go to your supply.  They go onto your player board in the "Acolytes" area.  You now spend them like resources (similar to Beavers).

You use these funds at the end of your Birdsong ("Perform Conspiracies in Outcast clearings"). You can ONLY perform these conspiracies in the Outcast suit.  So the Outcast suit is massively important for you because you may not be able to take the actions you want WHERE you want them if the Outcast suit isn't in a favorable spot for you.  You can perform as many "Conspiracies" as you want by "spending" your Acolytes (your warriors that have died).  When they get spent, they are returned to your supply.
    - Essential strategy: Dom swapping (Domination cards)
        - once a dominance card is discarded and goes into claim pile, the lizards have an infinite supply of scoring cards they can get via bird cards (using this tactic)
        - Example
            - they can claim a bunny dom card by discarding a bird
then they can play the bunny dom card to score
and it goes back to claim pile

            - then next turn can spend another bird card to claim again 
    - if your starting Lizard hand has a bunch of bunny cards, upper left is a great place to start because then you start with warriors on the upper 2 bunnies, and you can immediately recruit one or two more and build gardens.
    - I think opening turns with Lizards is all about picking one or two clearings and bum-rushing recruiting there to get rule and build gardens.  Don't spread out to other people's clearings, don't recruit in annoying places where they'll fight you, just recruit to get gardens out and have them defended with a lot of warriors so you can get your card draw and scoring engine going
    - Eyrie, WA, Lizards, Riverfolk all have capacity to come back from being 100% gone. Vagabond of course misses a turn and becomes a god again
    - Currently Lizards lose the most in tournament games:
        - Through 72 games of the current tournament, here you go. Keep in mind this is being played with AdvancedSetup (first tourney with it -- buffs for many including Cats, Corvids, and Lizards), Exiles & Partisans deck (nerfs for high crafters and buffs for cats), AND any vagabond draft has a random vagabond already assigned to it so you don't get to go pick Tinkerer:

Woodland Alliance – 42%
Lord of the Hundreds – 40%
Eyrie Dynasty – 30%
Underground Duchy – 28%
Marquise de Cat – 21%
Vagabond 2 – 20%
Corvid Conspiracy -18%
Riverfolk Company – 17%
Vagabond – 16%
Keepers in Iron – 13%
Lizard Cult – 9%
    - Lizards are victim to what cards they have in their hands.  This at least allows them to swap bird cards for other actionable cards
    - people mostly said save all your acolytes
it's like WA saving their 3rd base
only use if necessary
let them build up over time
obviously if you have bird cards and there are no dom cards, use the bird cards to get more acolytes
but as soon as dom cards are available
dom swap your bird cards in order to build more gardens and score consistently
    - revolting gives no acolytes. Only warriors lost DEFENDING in battle. So even attacking doesn't give them. Also lizards essentially have no capacity to kill sympathy tokens (but they also won't be moving much to generate outrage)
    - One game DanF won as Lizards by spreading way far away from the Woodland Alliance, really kinda keeping to himself, and gradually building up a VP scoring engine & crafting potential with gardens.
    - Dynamic with Woodland Alliance
        - I also imagine that having a woodland alliance in the game with lizards make it relaly hard for them to dictate outcast suit, since WA more than any other faction is going to be churning throuh discards every turn
    - Ian: Granted that this was our first online lizard game with the four of us, but I do get the sense that they would be more fun to play in a live game. Paying attention to the revealed cards in your hand, plus the discards from everyone making the lost souls/outcast would obviously inspire table talk, warnings and shifting of strategy. That can be done online. But as you already started to discuss, It's a little bit more tedious both with managing the UI and then you actually need to get off your fingers and type the table talk.
