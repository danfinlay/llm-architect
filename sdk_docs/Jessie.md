- A highly restrictive subset of [[JavaScript]], even a subset of [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]].
- Designed to
    - be the smallest possible implementation size
        - intended to be a target for [[formal verification]]
        - Should be simple enough to implement on any platform to enable extreme platform [[portability]].
- Relationship to [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]]
    - [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]] tries to be the largest subset of JS, maximizing compatibility.
    - Jessie tries to maximize certainty and unambiguity.
-  Aimed to achieve [[defensive consistency]]
- Etymology
    - JS-E, a nod to [[JavaScript]] and [[E (Language)]]
- Quirks
    - There is no `this`
        - Effectively has no prototypal inheritance.
    - All exported objects must be [[harden()]]
        - Not actually enforced by a static checker, but helps inferences of typescript be more accurate.
        - Can be compatible with the [[TypeScript]] `readonly` meta-type. Rejects property assignment, and so this allows [[harden()]] to be somewhat typed.
