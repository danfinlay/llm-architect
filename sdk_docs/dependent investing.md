- A dangerous investing strategy wherein one bases their investments on the actions, claims, and investments of others.

- This is in contrast to using a [[social collateral]] lending network. I discuss how a social collateral network can achieve [[perfect insurance]] in [[The Simplest Trustworthy Oracle]]
- Proof by negation
    - I claim that we cannot create a provably safe lending system on top of people basing investment decisions on external signals that could be changed given the right incentives. To prove this, I will prove the inverse: That it is always possible given enough incentive to corrupt a signal generator.
    - Assumptions
        - Everyone can have a price: For a high enough benefit, no one can be guarantees to be definitely not compromised.
        - Signal providers can be contacted and bribed.
    - Reasoning
        - We have a set of Signal Providers, `SP`, who each provide a signal `S` that is visible to Agent `A(1)`.
        - `A(1)` provides some compensation `C` to the `SP`.
        - `A(1)` is trying to make a decision about how to act. For each possible action the agent has, we have the set of `P(1, 2, .... i)`
        - For each `P(x)`, there are varying cost/benefits `CB` to all other Agents `A(2, 3, ..., i)`
        - `A(1)` is unable to account for the `CB` of all other agents, since this information can be private.
        - If the `CB(Px)` is either positive or negative for `A(x)`, they then have an incentive up to that level to provide bribe `B >= CB(Px)` to `SP`.
        - If the `B > C`, then `SP` will have incentive to corrupt signal `S`.
        - Since we cannot know what `CB(Px)` is, we must assume that it __could be__ arbitrarily large, and so we must conclude it is possible for this to happen, thus negating a guarantee of safety that can be achieved by such a construction.
