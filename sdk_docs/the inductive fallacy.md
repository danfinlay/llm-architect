- Just because something has always been one way, does not mean it will always be that way.
- Examples:
    - Sleeper agents
        - Just because a person has always appeared friendly to you does not mean their allegiance is to you.
    - [[The Truman Show]]
        - Just because your world seems to be one way does not mean that is its real limits.
    - [[The Matrix]]
        - Just because your world seems real does not mean it is not a simulation.
    - [[social echo chambers]]
        - Just because everyone appears to think one thing does not mean that everyone thinks that thing.
