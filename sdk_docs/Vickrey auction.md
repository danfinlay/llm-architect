- A **Vickrey auction** is a type of sealed-bid [auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction). Bidders submit written bids without knowing the bid of the other people in the auction. The highest bidder wins but the price paid is the second-highest bid. This type of auction is strategically similar to an [English auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction) and gives bidders an [incentive to bid their true value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_compatibility). The auction was first described academically by [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University) [professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor) [William Vickrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vickrey) in 1961[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction#cite_note-1) though it had been used by [stamp collectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_collecting) since 1893.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction#cite_note-2) In 1797 [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe) sold a manuscript using a sealed-bid, second-price auction.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction#cite_note-3)
