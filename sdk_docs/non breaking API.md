- A principle that a piece of software may choose to adhere to, wherein pre-existing interfaces are preserved for the sake of allowing as much external software to continue operating uninterupted as possible.
- The pursuit of minimizing [[breaking changes]]
- Seems to be particularly important for software that has an ecosystem of dynamic other software that interoperates with it.
- Types of software that seem to have widely adopted this concept
    - Operating Systems
        - demonstrated by [[Linus Torvalds]]
            - https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/gcc_vs_kernel_stability.html
            - [in this famous rant](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75)
    - Browsers
        - Chrome has a strict non breaking policy that states they try to only do it for security reasons
            - [[Manifest V3]] shows performance can also justify for them
- Types of software that have not yet widely adopted this concept, but probably should.
    - [[smart contract]]s.
    - [[blockchain]]s.
    - Software where things built on top may be static, unable to be updated, and so have no path to change with API breakage.
- Generally even software that tries to adhere to this principle will violate it in some cases
    - Fixing bugs
        - Making the API work the way people were doubtlessly expecting it to
    - Security fixes
        - When the existing implementation was impossible to use safely.
- Typical protocol for implementing a breaking change
    - Widely publicized communication, usually at least 6 months.
    - Ideally some kind of logging or warning messages that notify developers well in advance of the changes.
    - Ideally extremely simple instructions to follow to update off the now-breaking method.
        - Automated scripts are great.
        - New methods that cover the previous use cases are very good.
    - Tooling users can use to preserve old compatibility can be very valuable to them.
- Assorted comments
    - I think Linus is way ahead of the curve on what it means to support an ecosystem. I think I increasingly respect what he’s done as not just “made a good Unix clone” but “understood what it meant to nurture an ecosystem”, and part of that (an often unsung part) is non breaking API surface.
    - Related, I think that with more and more distributed applications, especially ones that __can__ have static code, non-breaking APIs are set to be a more common virtue than ever: Is your app “static, as in it can never be stopped?” or does it so much as depend on a single mutable service, as in it can go down at any moment?
        - Obviously nothing’s actually on that extreme edge, but appreciating your role in giving your ecosystem (those building on you) stability I think could become something that distinguishes long lasting web3 institutions from fleeting ones.
