- A [[JavaScript]] [[async [[membrane]]]] library by [[Dan Finlay]] intended to add some features that [[dnode]] lacked, like native [[Promises]] and [[event listeners]].
- [On GitHub](https://github.com/danfinlay/capnode)
- [On npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/capnode)
- Received a positive audit from [[Least Authority]]
- Allows for a more colloquial [[JavaScript]] development style than [[CapTP]], but some (like [[Mark Miller]]) argue that this is because it makes some hazardous patterns possible like 
    - “Making things happen and perceiving things are totally different, they shouldn’t be connected at all!” - [[Rich Hickey]]
        - This reminds me of how 
            - All references passed over [[CapTP]] are either [[record]]s or [[interface]]s.
        - Action and perception are sequential, and distinct.
- Regardless, some [[JavaScript]] have found it more approachable than full [[CapTP]], partly because it does not require the introduction of new syntax like [[Eventual Send]], even though that also means it loses out on [[Promise Pipelining]].
