- Proposed definitions
    - Hardened JavaScript
    - Secure EcmaScript: A subset of [[JavaScript]] that includes the [[JavaScript Compartment]] API to enable secure isolation of untrusted code, per the [[object capability (ocap)]] model.
    - A variation of [[JavaScript]] that is largely backwards-compatible that gives programs a leg to stand on in defending their own correctness.
        - Not a language, since it's a tool in the language that removes features from the language.
        - How do you explain adding security to a language by removing features?
    - Making JavaScript easily safe for
        - [[multi-tennancy]]
        - mashups
        - plugins
    - "JavaScript without the parts that others can use to hurt you." - [[Erik Marks]]
    - A runtime enforced compute environment that does better than [[Caja]].
        - We are trying to definitely not include a JS parser in the [[trusted computing base (TCB)]]. (We don't want to trust a parser, anyways).
- Designed and promoted by [[Agoric]] at [[TC-39]].
- Can allow safe isolation of code within a single [[JavaScript]] process.
    - Can be extended to exchanging [[power/capability]] over the process [[membrane]]
        - over authenticated channels using [[CapTP]]
        - over unauthenticated channels using [[ocap-ld]] or equivalent.
