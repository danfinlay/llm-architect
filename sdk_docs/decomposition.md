- Organizing software by breaking its function into hierarchical sub-functions.
- When faced with the need to write a program providing complex functionality, program- mers must subdivide the problem into manageable units. Emerging from the spaghetti-code software crisis of the 1960s [[Dij72]], programmers learned to practice hierarchical decompo- sition [[Wir71]], [[Mil76]], dividing each task into subtasks. To oversimplify a bit, each node in this decomposition tree was represented by a procedure which achieves its task partially by contracting out subtasks to the procedures it calls. Programmers would seek task divisions where the responsibilities of each procedure was clear, simple and separate.
