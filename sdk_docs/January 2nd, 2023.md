- [[endo]] weighing an issue on [[AsyncContext]]
    - https://github.com/endojs/endo/pull/1424#issuecomment-1369367635
    - Notes
        - The initial premise examples seem a little strange to me.
            - Why would se need to use a global `log` variable once in a callback that is associated with our special ID? Why wouldn't the callback receive the `log` variable, bound to that ID? That seems to be a more ergonomic/safe way to achieve the initially stated desired goal.
            - One part of the setup is "It is not always ergonomic (or even always possible) to pass a value through every function call", but from my experience, it's this kind of explicit parameter-passing endowment that makes [[object capability (ocap)]] so powerful, and an attempt to simplify this experience is basically asking to re-introduce the problems of [[ambient authority]].

            - V8 added async stack traces "but not all environments have this". Is that a reason to add a new omni-environment feature? Why not just advocate for async stack traces to be more widely implemented?
