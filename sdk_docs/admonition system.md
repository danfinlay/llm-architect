    - Alice asks Bob to not tell Carol.
        - Alice cannot enforce this request.

        - Bob may or may not want to comply. If he doesn't want to comply, no computer system can truly impede it. If he does want to comply, the computer system should make it easy for him to.
    - Bob wants to FTP a file to Carol.
        - An [[admonition system]] might say to Bob "you said you were trying to not tell Carol about this party, but if you share this folder, you will violate this promise."
