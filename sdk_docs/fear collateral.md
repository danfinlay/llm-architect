- A form of bond creation by intimidation.
- You can trust a person with as much as you believe they would be too afraid to betray you over.
- Can be chained together into a transitive trust graph with other forms of collateral, including [[social collateral]]
    - A person can be intimidated enough that they ask for favors from people who trust them, potentially burning those bridges if theyâ€™re more intimidated than they are afraid of damaging their relationship.
