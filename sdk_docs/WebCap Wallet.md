- A type of [[Ethereum]] [[contract account]] that allows for [[rich sharing]].
- This is a concept for a wallet, but has yet to be built. I believe it's a fairly simple set of changes to contracts that already exist (particularly [[[[Gnosis]] SAFE]]). I'm looking for someone who might be interested and able to build it, and I would be willing to pay for it. I'm considering hosting a contest or something, but would also be open to an enthusiastic individual who wanted the grant.
- Description
    - Since the delegation message can bonce the operator is able to sign messages that can become transactions in any order to a gnosis save, and has the ability to form meta-transactions that pre-commit to new contracts at deterministic addresses, the operator is then able to perform the following steps entirely without a transaction on chain.
        - Commit to a contract that allows another person's account to initiate transactions of any restricted form that will be forwarded to the parent contract.
        - Add to that new contract as a module so that it has permission to trigger transactions from the parent contract.
        - The pattern can be taken even further by assigning the permission to a new contract that is also being committed to publish. We can call this the delegate contract. if the delegate contract is itself a [[Counterfactual WebCap Wallet]], then it is able to recursively delegate any authority that it's been granted using similar off chain commitment messages.
    - Since these messages can be redeemed by anyone to the blockchain, they serve as a capability. If the delegate contract is used as the recipient of a new permission, then it must be assigned an owner account, and the private key for that account would be included to the recipient in a delegation message. Once the user had published that delegate account to the blockchain, they would be able to assign owner status to a different key, or any other [[[[[[Gnosis]] SAFE]] module]].
    - Combined with a meta-transaction service, redeeming these capabilities could eventually not even require holding either, since a delegation message could include a permission to refund transaction costs. That feature would not need to be part of the initial implementation, but should be an achievable feature that could be added to the delegation contracts later on.
