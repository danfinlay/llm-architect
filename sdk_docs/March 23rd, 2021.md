- [[CommonJS]] vs [[esm]] module distinction
    - Any bundler that supports both ESM and CJS must use some heuristics to identify the names of all transitive dependencies of any imports, because ESM allows `export * from ‘other-module’`, which draws namespace from those imported modules, while a CJS module may not define its exports until they are run, and so a bundler needs to perform heuristics/interpretation to anticipate what names will be exported from a CJS module when it is imported into an ESM module.
