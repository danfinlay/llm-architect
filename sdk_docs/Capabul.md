## A vision of the future of society enabled by technology and trust.
Founded and primarily written and edited by [[Dan Finlay]]

A place where I gather my thoughts on how we can use our networked computers to better cooperate, and maybe just have a better chance to tackle some of our giant collective problems.
Often builds on some [[core assumptions]] that build up to a theory of [[digital [[social collateral]]]].
Has many ways that its principles can be explored in practice.
    - [[peer to peer lending]]
    - [[personal token]]
    - [object capabilities]([[object capability (ocap)]])
    - [[Delegatable Eth]]
    - [[MobyMask]]

Kindred spirits
    - I've collected [a twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/982424357942132736) of people who I've seen observe or build on these same principles.
        - It has significant overlap with [this other twitter list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1347947433456648192).
History
    - [[October 25, 2016]] On an evening walk, Dan recorded a voice memo where he wrestled with the ideas of coordinating a human organization where new membership is invited but does not expose the organization to undue levels of new risk. Dan leaves this session with a strong impression that there is in fact a best-possible solution to the problem of peer to peer lending, but does not leave it with a concrete description of the solution.
        - Voice memo is named [[Trusting Graph Theory]].
    - Dan becomes enthusiastic to find people who have had similar ideas, and so pursues things claiming to be "decentralized lending."
        - [Wrote a critical analysis](https://medium.com/@danfinlay/phi-decentralized-lending-and-stable-currency-might-not-actually-be-stable-36f472948591) of [[[[Dfinity]] Phi]].
    - Dan has a moment of clarity whereby trying to step through the simplest case (two, and then a three-person lending group), is able to roughly derive the core observations of [[social collateral]].
    - Dan [tweeted out the basic idea](https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/934308978225319936?s=20&t=_hqKGQ7mRtXbp80-0hzMkw), and got a ton of responses and leads for related projects that he would be reading up on for the next couple of years.
        - https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/934308978225319936
    - [[May 20, 2018]] Dan writes out his basic line of reasoning from [[core assumptions]] in the post [Building Trust Over Distance](https://medium.com/capabul/cooperation-is-the-game-of-trust-that-humanity-is-currently-losing-7fb5f152a548). Now syndicated here as a living document: [[Building Trust Over Distance]].
    - Over the next month, Dan maps out [a map of related concepts](http://danfinlay.com/p2p-wot-map.svg), seeking the fundamental components of the observation.
    - [[June 1st, 2020]] Dan writes [[counterfactual social collateral cash]]
    - [[February 14, 2019]] Dan comes to realize how the notions of [[social collateral]] combine with [[object capability (ocap)]] to imply a specific road map for a wallet like [[MetaMask]].
        - Records a voice memo to state this path. Called [[The Big Vision]].
        - Identifies the problems of social cohesion as the same problems as secure software composition.
