- While I often profess the law of [[social collateral]] as You must not lend more to another than that other values your relationship, I'd like to highlight how reality plays into this.
- You never really know how much another values your relationship, and so this is always a gradient.
    - You may know a person definitely likes you at least a little bit.
    - You may __suspect__ a person likes you a lot.
- When choosing what you're willing to risk in another person's hands, you're forced to make a bet along that gradient.
    - This is why even in a high-trust environment, a person might still honor a [[principle of least authority (POLA)]]
        - excess risk can strain a relationship even subconsciously.
        - Minimizing risk frees a relationship up to leverage its [[social collateral]] for other things that might come up.
        - [[conservation of trust]]
