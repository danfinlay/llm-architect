- A special object that is bound to its enclosing function.
- live-bound to the argument variables.
    - reassigning an `arguments` member will reassign that local variable, which is very weird.
- While allows index lookups, does not inherit from [[Array.prototype ([[JavaScript]] primitive)]]
- arguments.caller and arguments.callee is part of [[sloppy mode ([[JavaScript]])]], which violates [[object capability (ocap)]] security.
    - `FunctionObject.arguments`
        - Allows accessing the last arguments thrown to this function.
    - `FunctionObject.caller` 
        - Gives you the object that called this function, which lets you access your caller.
- In strict mode
    - `FunctionObject.arguments`
        - No such property, or a projerty inherited from `Function.prototype` whose accessor only throws.
    - `FunctionObject.caller` 
        - No such property, or a projerty inherited from `Function.prototype` whose accessor only throws.
