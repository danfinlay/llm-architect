- The technique of having recursive, transitive [[referral fees]] to incentivize cooperative behavior, as seen in the strategy of the winning [[[[DARPA]] Network Red Balloon Challenge]] participants.
- Basic Concept
    - Some exclusive set of people are given the right to receive an award for completing an achievement.
    - Those people are able to share their would-be award with others, who are able to recursively make the same deal.
    - Effectively you've created a referral program where anyone can refer, and everyone has incentive to refer instead of complete the task if they are not able to complete the task alone.
- Variations
    - In the [[[[DARPA]] Network Red Balloon Challenge]] winner, the final referrer got the best price, with diminishing prizes for the referrers:
        - Finder would get $2000, and their inviter would get 1/2 of that, and so on down to $250. If fewer than 4 hops invited the winner, the rest would go to charity.
            - This has a vulnerability: It pays out the most to the longest invite chain, and so encourages long invite chains, which is slightly gameable. This problem doesn't manifest as very large with a mere 10 balloon challenge and only $2000 per balloon, but should be considered for larger scale implementations.
    - In an [[object capability (ocap)]] model, any eligible inviter could determine what their cut would be of anyone they invited, which creates a competitive market for invitations which can scale to any number of hops, and is not gameable.

- Incentive tree use case examples
    - Selling tickets to an exclusive event, like [[Burning Man]]:
        - You add a commission to each friend you invite, and thus can set your commission according to how badly you want that person to have access, or what youâ€™d want to be paid for them to get access.
    - Creating a [[0x Protocol]] style relay system except that it supports arbitrarily deep tries of aggregators.
    - Buying shares of a vacation house, or a retreat, or a [[Community Supported Agriculture  (CSA)]]
        - Rather than having a fully public market, you have a market where each sale and each price increase is intimately connected to the recipient of the opportunity.
