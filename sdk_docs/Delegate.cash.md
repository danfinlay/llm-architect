- A [[evm]] [[delegation]] framework

- Differences from [[Delegatable Eth]]
    - Keeps all delegations on chain
        - Makes lookups and revocations more certain, not dependent on users retaining their signature history
            - This could be addressed by a [[wallet]] persisting all signatures in a well backed up way.
        - Makes all delegations require eth, and payment for unused delegations
        - Allows delegations from contracts in the same forms
            - This is no longer actually a distinction from Delgegatable Eth, post [[[[[[EIP]] 1271: Standard Signature Validation Method for Contracts]] variant of [[Delegatable Eth]]]]
    - Has a an immutable number of delegation types, vs an open ended [[caveat]] system.
        - It is unclear what abilities each type of delegation should convey

    - Delegations are one hop deep, and so does not appear to support transitive delegation.
