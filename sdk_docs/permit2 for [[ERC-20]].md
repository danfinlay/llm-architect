- library to inherit from: https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/main/src/libraries/Permit2Lib.sol
- Features
    - Signatures that allow issuing token allowances on some limited terms
        - For the next transaction only
        - can have an expiration [[caveat]]
    - Allowances are [[counterfactual]]
        - No evidence they support [[transitive [[delegation]]]]
    - All its operations support [[Batch Transactions]]
        - Thereâ€™s a lot of momentum to get this broadly available at the account level via [[account abstraction (AA)]], but I do think every contract should do what they can to provide batching.
    - Any [[ERC-20]] can benefit by the user first issuing an unlimited allowance to the new permit contract.
        - This can also be achieved for [[Delegatable Eth]] via approaches like [[WETHA]], but in a general purpose (not token bound) way.
