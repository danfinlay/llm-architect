- I really think more Ethereum people need to understand the ideas of Egor Homakov on scaling. Most of his writing is as critique of [[[[Bitcoin]] Lightning]], but it all applies to multi-[[evm]] ecosystems, too. It's very exciting to me that he's implementing XLN on Ethereum now.
- A security engineer and [[layer 2]] scaling engineer.
- Creator of [[Extended Lightning Network (XLN)]]
- Has worked to publicize [[The Inbound Capacity Problem]] as a problem with scaling transfers across ledgers, and how scaling these transfers may fundamentally require [[credit line]] extended between ledgers to enable sending to ledgers that otherwise do not have capital locked up on them.
- Had an idea similar to [[browser bootloader]] called [[secure bookmark]]
