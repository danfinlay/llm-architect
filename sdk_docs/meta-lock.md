- A protocol intended for a subjective and massively concurrent network of independent consensus systems to dynamically assign atomic operations throughout their fabric through a bidding process, as the ultimate evolution of my [[Caputi]] and in turn [[Caputo (concurrency)]] concept.
- Protocol
    - ThereMessage Alice.sign
        - message type: “[[.there()]]”
        - Max price offered: [[gas price]]
        - method identifier
        - redemptionMethod: pointer to how to redeem a successful Executor.completedBid for payment.
        - parameters[ [[record]] | [[interface]] ]
            - record
            - interface:
                - object-identifier [[macaroon]]
                - Basically an [[ocap-ld]] capability object.
                - How to connect to the host & acquire locks (url, other network identifier, etc...)
    - Executor.receives ThereMessage Alice.sign. If executor recognizes the protocols for How to connect to the host & acquire locks (url, other network identifier, etc...) and is confident it can obtain locks, etc, then returns a bid object.
    - Executor.signBid
        - Reference to: ThereMessage Alice.sign
        - [[Slashable Proof]]
        - Price offered to do
        - Claimed time to do it by
            - Yes this will have to be subjective, but it will be enforced by whatever policy is defined in [[Slashable Proof]].
        - Offer good until (approx time, may return rejection, also subject to [[Slashable Proof]])
    - Alice.acceptBid
        - reference to: Executor.signBid
    - Either:
        - Executor.rejectBid(((jpWgFJw6L)))
        - Executor.completedBid
            - Reference to: Alice.acceptBid
