- Built by [[Lars Ramussen]] and [[Jens Ramussen]]
    - The same pair of brothers that built the original [[[[Google]] Maps]]
- Notes on architecture
    - a conversation object is a tree of message nodes
    - any person in a wave can reply to a message, even inline to it.
        - an author of a reply can restrict its access to any subset 
    - new messages are shown live to other participants by default
    - v1 built in 1.5 years
    - Had a plugin system
        - plugins seemed to get some flat/universal access, no permissions system
