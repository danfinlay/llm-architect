- ## Exploring the unity of [[social collateral]] and [[object capability (ocap)]]
- When I first had [my social collateral epiphany]([[Building Trust Over Distance]]), I got a lot of things to read from friends, and I spent a while trying to imagine how such a thing would be efficiently implemented on [[Ethereum]].
- At one point I came up with a concept I called [[counterfactual social collateral cash]], which involved recursively chainable messages that could be redeemed for an underlying asset. It served as a sort of branching delegation tree but didn't need to be stored __entirely __on-chain, the way [[Trustlines]] does (only revocations need to be on chain).
- At some point during my effort to define the ideal data structure for this system, I came upon the [[ocap-ld]] spec, and I instantly saw the similarity of the two efforts, but what __blew my mind__ was that it became clear that the [[social collateral]] concept didn't only apply to forms of currency, but to anything that can be expressed as a function, which is effectively any kind of [[power/capability]] at all.
    - This helped explain why I had strained so hard to articulate what the thing is that is delegated in [my explorations of an ideal trust-delegation system](((D7K0wbdM2))): The answer is fully open-ended.
- With this new understanding, suddenly the power of the insights of [[social collateral]] and [[Trustlines]] was not just about expanding access to capital, but expanding access to __any scarce resource__.
- With that understanding, I have since gone deep into the field of [[object capability (ocap)]], and I am still reading through the vast literature available through [[Mark Miller]]'s website.
- The key insight that now drives much of my original [[social collateral]] inspiration into lower level tooling is that the tools for extending social collateral need to not only exist, but will inevitably need to iterate, and be easy to create in as many contexts as possible. This isn't just about access to money, this is access to all the capabilities that people need to thrive.
    - This perspective was reinforced by the positive research coming from [[capability approach]] to charity, which conveniently has a similar name.
    - This seems like an ideal digital language for attempting to answer the criteria "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need."
- A few ways that these principles apply in ways that weren't immediately apparent to me:
    - The ways that people opt into currency systems themselves also resemble this trust extending pattern.
    - The way that people install software onto their devices also is subject to extending trust, and often unfortunately results in extending far more trust than a person probably meant to.
    - Every expression of power is a valid candidate for such a web of capabilities, and so "no one ledger" would be enough, but instead the most ideal infrastructure for facilitating cooperation would allow sharing capabilities of very different types.
    - Since many systems would ideally be part of such a system, the tools that facilitate making compatible systems would also become a critical bottleneck in the proliferation of the most secure sharing systems.
    - Systems like this extend to the bottom of the stack:
        - Language-level expressiveness of delegation is what is called [[object capability (ocap)]].
        - Higher-level ability to share/delegate permissions has been called [[rich sharing]] by [[Marc Stiegler]].
- You can read a bit more about how some of these concepts are being built by [[Agoric]] in [[Gratitude for [[Agoric]]]]
