- An [[Ethereum]] [[DAO]] deploying framework, oriented at crowdfunding.
    - Deposit a token, get a governance token back
    - Usually a multisig with snapshots
    - 5% of all funds spent go to the JuiceBox protocol, in exchange for some of the tokens at the current rate.
        - Allows splitting your token proceeds
    - Sells on "funding cycles", and adjusts its sale rate between cycles.
- [[SharkDAO]] is the most popular [[JuiceBox]] [[DAO]]
- Cool emergent phenomenon: People contracting, receiving a recurring allocation of funding, and then evolving from an independent contractors into new DAOs to serve those roles
    - Roles that have done this
        - media
        - community management
    - This "building trust until it becomes delegated" really resonates with other themes of this graph, like [[social collateral]] and [[delegation]].
- Lead dev [[Django? [[JuiceBox]] dev]] is making it all more modular, like the "funding strategy": What happens in response to new funding? Get the base token by default.
