        - Nice intro!
        - I would skip the claim “No single entity can seize assets, reverse transactions, or change the ruleset for a given blockchain.” because it creates an unnecessary and ill defined dichotomy that excludes some proof of authority betworks and other hash linked computers like [[Spritely]] or a [[SwingSet]]
