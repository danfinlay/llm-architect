- A Javascript object that exists as a default property on all javascript intrinsics and on constructor functions. This object dictates the properties and functions of any instance that is created from the corresponding constructor function or intrinsic. It is writable by default, so it is therefore also used to extend the default functionality of instances. 
- Example: `String` has a prototype with a list of builtin functions like `slice()` & `split()`. Any instance of `String` in Javascript such as "Hello" or "World" has access to these functions because each string inherits properties & functions from `String.prototype`.
