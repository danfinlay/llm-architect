- Curating some recommended resources for newcomers to get acquainted with Spritely.
- First, my own introduction & commentary
    - Spritely is aiming to build a new model for the internet that is both secure and collaborative.
        - [Read a tweet thread where I kinda rapid-fire summarize the concept](https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/1560751433355407360)

    - Built by some very cool people
        - [[Christine Lemmer Webber]]
        - [[F. Randall ("Randy") Farmer]]
    - The general architecture & design goals of Spritely are extremely relevant to the main focus of this graph [[Capabul]]. In some ways it represents the most pure, high-leverage attempt at a proper [[distributed [[object capability (ocap)]]]] system in development today. It builds on the ideas from [[Networked Communities]] and [[Agoric]] and [[Joule (language)]] and the [[E Language]] and introduces a new extremely quick way of prototyping, validating, & developing out a distributed and extensible computing system.
        - In a few months of experimentation, the [[Spritely]] version of [[CapTP]] had [[[[presence]] handoffs]], which the [[JavaScript]] version still lacks as of [[September 3rd, 2022]], meaning it (or at least [[Christine Lemmer Webber]]) has proven a fast way to iterate on some of these secure distributed language ideas faster than seemingly anyone else in the world.
    - The project is being run as a nonprofit organization, and publishing as open source, and is seeking grants for funding.
    - In this model, there is no [[blockchain]] necessary. By default users create their own contracts/functions/variables and simply share access with each other to those things. Intermediary servers can serve for replication purposes, but they can always be routed around, and are not necessary, which [helps address some issues]([[OcapPub]]) with [[ActivityPub]] type protocols.
        - However, [it is possible for this model to allow blockchains to grow from it](((fUItkd2c3))), and there is no reason they canâ€™t interoperate as a pair of complementary and interoperating virtual machines.
    - This means basic interaction does not require "buy-in" the way blockchains do, and so it's much less likely to be perceived as a [[ponzi scheme]], while still allowing smart contracting to develop through a dynamic process of selecting escrow of larger public chains as a settlement layer. To me this resembles [[The Simplest Trustworthy Oracle]].
    - As it is a true [[distributed [[object capability (ocap)]]]] system, the security model goes "all the way down" to the syntax of the language. Unlike [[Agoric]] who chose to attempt to make [[JavaScript]] secure through the [[ses-shim]] and the [[TC-39]] standards process, Spritely chose a much smaller/simpler language as a starting point, which makes proving safety of the environment much easier.
        - There are some drawbacks to the [[Scheme]] approach
            - It does not currently run as widely as many other languages: Neither on browsers nor on IoT, and so getting the scheme environment running more widely is an important step towards enabling the Spritely goals.
                - Spritely has submitted a grant to the [[[[MetaMask]] Grants [[DAO]]]] to address this point.
            - It is not already as popular with developers as [[JavaScript]], so initial adoption requires a bit of special effort.
                - Fortunately, the language itself can be basically learned in about an hour, as shown in [[A [[Scheme]] Primer]]. This however does not also teach the Spritely framework, as covered in [[Heart of [[Spritely]]]] which could surely be supplemented with a developer quick-start.
            - It is not as performant as a low level system language like [[rust (language)]]. Long term it would even be good if new hardware were made to optimize around this kind of security kernel.
                - [[RISC]] was originally designed as a lisp-centric hardware, the [[[[Lisp]] Machine]]. So it's possible to create hardware that is optimized for safe languages, this approach just isn't currently common.
    - Part of the approach is to not only create a language level security model, but to standardize a [[CapTP]] transport layer that can bridge many language environments with the same security model. The effort to standardize between [[Agoric]] and [[Spritely]] (and eventually any number of environments) is currently being pursued by the [[O'Capn]] group.
- Second, some primary sources from the Spritely team
    - This talk covers the team's background and user-facing goals, and even includes some wireframe/prototypes.

    - Then, to really get into their approach, which relates to why they're using [[Scheme]] as a programming language, it's basically necessary to learn the basics of this simple language and why it has the flexibility needed to allow the kinds of innovation that are required by these security goals. They've prepared a paper and talk on that topic here.
