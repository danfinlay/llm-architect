- MetaMask's [inpage-provider](https://github.com/MetaMask/inpage-provider) is injected into every page the user visits, and allows sites to request permissions to view the user's account.
- When the user approves this request, invocations of the method `eth_accounts` will return an array with that account's hex-prefixed address.
- There are many places MetaMask could be customized to "spoof" having an address locally without having the key available
    - One way without needing to customize MetaMask is to make MetaMask think you've connected this address via a hardware wallet, without even creating a new build. (Maybe actually too hard, requires some custom javascript just to generate the binary to inject)
        - Steps
            - Install MetaMask in Chrome
            - Also install [Storage Area Explorer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/storage-area-explorer/ocfjjjjhkpapocigimmppepjgfdecjkb)
            - Set up MetaMask and unlock it
            - Open the developer tools at [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and enable "Developer mode" in the top right
            - Open the chrome developer tools to inspect MetaMask at [chrome://extensions/?id=nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn](chrome://extensions/?id=nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)
            - Click "Inspect views: Background page"
            - Click the "Storage explorer" tab
            - Copy the `data` key out, paste it into a text editor where you can modify the JSON blob.
            - Okay this next step probably makes this prohibitively difficult.
            - Replace the `KeyringController.vault` value with a blob that is encrypted with password-encryptor whose form matches the keyringController's serialized format for a hardware wallet, like this one: https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-trezor-keyring/blob/main/test/test-eth-trezor-keyring.js#L107
    - Simplest method of customizing MetaMask would be to just change what the inpage-provider returns
        - Pull down the metamask extension repo and follow its build steps: https://github.com/metamask/metamask-extension/
        - in `node_modules/@metamask/inpage_provider/src/MetaMaskInpageProvider.ts` you'll want to basically just overwrite every assignment to `selectedAddress` to be your target address.
        - You'll have to rebuild that module in order for your local MetaMask to be able to use it on rebuild.
