    - The act of [[designation]] is also the act of access.
    - To delegate under an [[Access Control List (ACL)]] an agent has to grant full identity. [[confused deputy]]
        - Unless they forward an attenuated function.
- In an operating system, the kernel maps each process's file descriptors to other open files.
- We can't freeze such a process and move it (portably) without also moving the heap of file descriptors, etc.
- Instead of having file descriptors, you could map numbers to external resources, but those external resources are objects.
- The C-list is the analog of the FD table in the [[CapTP]] world
- A file descriptor is a C-List entry.
- [[Capsicum]] is a capability system layered on top of [[Unix]] following the adage "Don't add security, remove insecurity". Removes everything except [[file descriptor]]s, and forces users to use unix domain sockets to open directories, and interact between them.
- openat() is fd-based; you don't have to go as far as unix domain sockets.
