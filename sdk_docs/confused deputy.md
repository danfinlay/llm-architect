- From Wikipedia
    - In [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), the **confused deputy problem** is often cited as an example of why [[object capability (ocap)]] based security is important. A **confused deputy** is a legitimate, more privileged [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that is tricked by another program into misusing its authority on the system.  It is a specific type of [privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation) [[vulnerability]].
    - [[object capability (ocap)]] based systems protect against the confused deputy problem, whereas [[Access Control List (ACL)]]-based systems [do not]([[[[Access Control List (ACL)]]s Don't]]).
