- Building on the thinking of [[Delegatable 4337]]
- [[Delegatable Eth]] can either be included in an account, an application, (or both!)
    - in the account
        - pros
            - a user can issue delegations that are not related to a specific application/other contract.
            - Can allow graphs of [[digital [[social collateral]]]]
                - Can allow users to send allowances to other users (no intermediary application)
        - cons
            - to interact with applications using these delegations, those applications would need to (OR):
                - know how to receive/handle delegatable delegations
                - implement a [[general purpose delegation framework for [[evm]]]]
    - in the application
        - pros
            - Anyone can use delegations for any application that supports delegations today.
            - Allows faster application iteration/development
            - Has no requirement on ecosystem-wide standard delegation adoption, which is nice for iteration.
        - cons
            - leaves users unable to perform granular delegations from non-cooperating applications.
            - cannot trivially enable delegations across different contracts.
