- Adds a new opcode (CREATE2) at 0xf5, which takes 4 stack arguments:
    - endowment
    - memory_start
    - memory_length
    - salt
- Behaves identically to CREATE (0xf0), except using keccak256( 0xff ++ address ++ salt ++ keccak256(init_code))[12:]
    - address
    - salt
    - init_code
        - the code that, when executed, produces the runtime bytecode that will be placed into the state, and which typically is used by high level languages to implement a ‘constructor’.
