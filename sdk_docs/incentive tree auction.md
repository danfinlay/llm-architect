- Mashup of [[MATT: An [[NFT]] Auction Concept]], [[incentive trees]], and [[Delegatable Eth]].
- Premise
    - A [[MATT: An [[NFT]] Auction Concept]] with the bid method set to be exclusive to the issuer, that inherits [[Delegatable Eth]]
    - [[delegation]] is used to form a transitive invitation system of [[incentive trees]]
        - The owner gives minting rights to some select group first.
        - the new invitees can then add a commission caveat to invitations they issue
        - anyone they invite (transitively) would have to pay this referral fee to place a bid
        - these invitees thus have an incentive to get others to buy in using their own link, while keeping the fee acceptably low.
