- An essential theme of this databse [[Capabul]].
- The notion that while you don't know anything for sure, you will build up experiences that you feel strongly enough about to make a bet on.
- We never seem to quite nail down the truth, though. Our best seems to be a
 sort of [[leap of faith]]; even gravity is just a theory: a single contradiction would throw it out the window, and yet we gradually build up theories of the world that we put more and more of our weight on, that we rely on with every step that we take.
