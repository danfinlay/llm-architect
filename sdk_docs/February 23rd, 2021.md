- [[[[endo]] [[LavaMoat]] Call]]
    - [[Robert Axelrod]] and the game theory of cooperation.
        - wrote on the [[iterated prisoner's dilemna]]
            - If the end-game has some randomness as to when it ends, you get [[tit for tat]] results
            - Put together a computational tournament, and had people send him solutions, and he ran them against each other.
                - Basically all programs performed worse than [[tit for tat]]. All others got into "meanness loops".
            - There is a slight refinement that can beat [[tit for tat]]: [[tit for two-tats]]
        - Has been studying political polarization.
            - What patterns in stating opinions and responding to those result in polarization.
        - [[The Evolution of Trust]]
    - [[LavaMoat]] is now in the [[MetaMask]] [[WebExtension]] build system!
    - [[Mark Miller]]'s [[enhanced error reporting under the [[ses-shim]]]]
        - How we debug today
            - Maybe using a lot of debuggers, breakpoints, and console.logs.
        - Based on [[Causeway]]
            - [[Waterken]]
    - [[Jessie]]
        - Could this run on [[Ethereum]]?
            - [[optimistic rollup (OR)]]
            - compilation vs interpretation
                - compilation can make it much more efficient to target expensive targets.
                - Could make a typed subset of [[Jessie]]
                - Currently [[eval]] could cause infinite loops, and so using interpretation is already dangerous (until we have strong JS [[metering]]).
            - [[Starkware]] [[Cairo]]
        - [[[[TypeScript]] is unsound]]
            - Could help [[TypeScript]] be sound
            - Since you can have static values, you can make stronger type assumptions.
        - An [[object capability (ocap)]] language is about [[integrity]] not about [[confidentiality]].
    - Problems with [[npm]] and [[yarn]] [[dependency]] name claims.
