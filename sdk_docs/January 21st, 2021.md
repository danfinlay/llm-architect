- [[Agoric]] Pillar series [[live stream]]
    - How we arrived at Agoric's work
        - We pioneered how interactive a cryptocurrency wallet should be with the outside world: Not just sending and receiving funds, but now arbitrary interactions
    - Outline from semino
        - Just some high-level notes on topics we can discuss for the call. Feel free to make edits as necessary: 
        - 1. Discuss SES and how it provides the sandboxing of 3rd party packages. 
        - 2. Agoric builds the infrastructure primitive, MetaMask has built LavaMoat on top of that. Dan and Mark can then talk about their roles / collaborative work. 
        - 3. Dan can go more into LavaMoat which provides protection against supply-chain injection attacks while embracing largely the existing body of common JS modules and npm. Mark can comment on the JS modules + expand from LavaMoat specifically. 
        - 4. Mark discuss some of the standards Agoric wants to bring to JavaScript - Dan discuss MetaMask and its vision to expand the conversation.
