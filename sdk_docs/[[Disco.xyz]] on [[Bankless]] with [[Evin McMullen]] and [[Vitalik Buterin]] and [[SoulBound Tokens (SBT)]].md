- Notes
    - Evan
        - [[data backpack]]
            - Seems like the kind of thing we’re making [[[[MetaMask]] Snaps]] for.
        - [[[[Kim Cameron]]’s 6 Laws of [[identity]]]]
    - [[Vitalik Buterin]] named [[SoulBound Tokens (SBT)]] after World of Warcraft because he likes that it is able to prevent sale, and today it seems anything that can be transferred will be sold.
        - I think this is more a symptom of modern attitudes towards transferability, and if more token drops were made explicitly to people who were trusted to have our interests in mind, we would not need mechanisms to prevent transferability to make systems not be auctioned off.
        - There are also reasons that actually enforced non transferability may be impossible (at least in some cases like [[contract account]])s.
        -  a safe recovery system may look a lot like [[revocation]] and re-issuing a [[delegation]].
    - Vitalik dislikes [[token-weighted vote]] systems
        - This motivates many of his use cases for [[SoulBound Tokens (SBT)]]
        - How to ensure votes are more relevant
        - How to ensure votes aren’t the same person?
            - I would ask: Why is this one important? If votes were shown to be by people who had all the qualities you sought. This one extra aside brings huge technical requirements along with it.
    - Vitalik expresses that he thinks it would be a bad thing if a government or other powerful body could a crew many identities, and then achieve massive things with a single vote.
        - to me this could sound like a single trusted entity having been endowed many rights from many individuals to act on their behalves, and if we do not allow for that potential, we will be entrenching ourselves in a situation where people permanently must think about things they might not be expert in, And decisions must be made by non-experts.
    - He touches on key rotation!
        - like [[[[EIP]] 5003: AUTH_USURP]]
    - Talks about use of [[SoulBound Tokens (SBT)]] as allowing people to be marked by loans they have taken out.
        - obviously anyone can always make a new key pair, so this means the loans would be dependent on something other than the marking of having a loan.
        - I don’t think this is actually enforceable, but I think that even if it was it would be somewhat dystopian, since the very concept of lending and an obligation to repay without forgiveness can create a debt cycle and indenture people.
    - Evan talks a bit about how bad it is when you can receive a token without your consent.
        - Her solutions seem to be mostly on chain, enforced by individual contracts protocol, but this doesn’t solve the problem because a single contract violating the protocol violates the expectation that tokens are consentful. this is why I have advocated for Wallet to take the responsibility of ensuring that receiving tokens is consensual. See[[[[airdrop]] scams]]
        - All of these issues can pretty much also be solved by having new addresses per characteristic, and making non-association the default.
