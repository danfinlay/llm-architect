- When [[Ethereum]] was designed, it was built with a concept of an [[externally owned account (EOA)]], which had some built-in assumptions.
    - All transactions begin with an [[ecdsa]] signature
        - Prevented the adoption of new cryptography at the base layer.
            - [[post [[quantum computing]] security]]
            - [[n of m multisig]] accounts
            - [[zero-knowledge proofs]] [[privacy]]
    - gas payment can only be paid by these EOAs
    - [[nonce based [[replay protection]]]]
- Account abstraction has become a label for making the entry-point for a given [[blockchain]] transaction more general-purpose, more like the core ethos of [[Ethereum]]'s [[evm]].
- Has been composed of many proposals over the years.
    - [[[[EIP]] 2938: [[account abstraction (AA)]]]]
    - [[[[EIP]] 4337: [[account abstraction (AA)]] via Entry Point Contract]]
- Some proposals require [[hard fork]]s
    - [[[[EIP]] 2938: [[account abstraction (AA)]]]]
- Some proposals achieve partial abstraction through new formats of contract accouns
    - [[[[EIP]] 4337: [[account abstraction (AA)]] via Entry Point Contract]]
- There are some living protocols that claim to have implemented account abstraction.
    - [[StarkNet]]
