- A form of token-based democracy in which the winners of a vote pay the losers what the losers bid.
    - Similar to a [[Vickrey auction]]
- Process
    - Tokens are distributed among community members
    - Proposals are submitted to the group
        - Proposals have a voting period
        - Any user can vote for or against a proposal by locking tokens for or against that proposal.
        - When the voting period ends, the proposal is adopted or rejected according to which side locked the most tokens.
            - Of the funds locked for the winning side, the losing voters are all paid the amount they locked.
            - The remaining funds locked for the winning side are distributed proportionately to the accounts that had locked for the winning side.
- Properties
    - If all users bid the amount that they truly value the passing of this proposal, then they should always be happy
        - If they win, they will pay no more than the amount they value this proposal.
        - If they lose, they will be fully compensated for not getting their desired outcome.
    - Easily private
        - Since there is a voting period, it can incorporate a commit-reveal scheme.
            - Users can lock more than they are voting at any time, since only the amount __actually__ committed is potentially spent in the end.
            - Multiple votes can rely on the same pool of actually-locked funds.
                - Upon each reveal, the remaining locked funds are accounted for.
                - Any funds that are not available at the time of tallying are not counted towards that side's vote.
