- A place for evaluating the merits of [[CapTP]] vs [[Capnode]]
- Capnode benefits
    - Works with many JS modules out of the box.
    - Has a more intuitive style for existing [[JavaScript]] developers
        - No need for special syntax like [[tildot syntax]]
- CapTP benefits
    - Constrains usage to safe usage
    - Promise pipelining support
    - Things I learned from [[Mark Miller]] once getting to discuss the distinction with him
        - All references passed over [[CapTP]] are either [[record]]s or [[interface]]s.
        - Laziest possible responses with built in caching using [[Eventual Send]]
        - The [[hilbert hotel]] for encoding
        - The goal of [[[[presence]] handoffs]] 
        - [[.there()]] as an alternative to pipelining
