- Premise:
    - a platform for making apps on signed messages, and gossiping messages that could be posted on chain.
        - So could be friendly to [[Delegatable Eth]] type systems.
- Architecture
    - Each user has a "canvas core"
        - A personal chain of messages & state
        - Similar to a [[vat]], or [[caplet]].
    - Built on [[Hypercore]]'s DHT
        - Making up for its lack of multi signer support by building a [[QuickJS]] based VM "account abstraction" for Hypercore.
            - Built hooks for QuickJS into Hypercore, so the user's validation function is extensible.
    - Moving to [[libp2p]] or other gossip protocols instead of using hypercore's networking directly.
    - Gossiping on [[libp2p]]
        - [[Matrix (protocol)]] seems overly federated
        - [[Waku]] sounds like they're planning on bonding to participate in the network.
    - All data then hosted over [[IPFS]]
    - Has some hooks for calling out to [[Ethereum]]
        - Ability to request state from the chain.
- Building some prototypes
    - Building on [[Commonwealth]]
