    - Import endo bundlers into agoric-sdk
        - commonJS support working pending release
        - StaticModuleRecord now factored out of SES
        - Also broke out the commonJS lexer since no more runtime module transforming!
        - Kris has implemented [[Syrup]] in JS
        - the [[endo]] archive is a [[Syrup]] file
        - [[Compartment Mapper]]
            - Trying to decouple [[babel.js]]
            - Ran into issue with [[resm]] that made it difficult to have multiple entry-point modules.
            - Possible solutions
                - Break up CompartmentMapper into more modules with their own entry-points
                - Add support for [[Node.js]] exports field.
        - Considering moving more packages from [[agoric-sdk]] to the [[endo]] repository
            - Need to port to [[ProperJS]], so it can build to [[CommonJS]]
            - Will then use `git subtree` to migrate them into place.

            - We should try to add performance regression tests under [[lockdown]] to the [[V8 Engine]] regression tests, because recently assignment to [[TypedArray]] objects experienced a 100x slowdown.
                - {{[[TODO]]}} [[Kumavis]] to raise this to V8 team.

        - [[Brian Warner]] [xsnap should allow non-fatal metering faults](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/2979)
            - the zoe [[zcf [[vat]]]] creates one per contract
                - If the vat dies or the zcf is corrupted, we experience no problem.

        - Is there a model for reverting a portion of execution like in [[Ethereum]]?
            - There is a model for committing your state, and there is a way to throw away portions of execution. Not yet.
            - Workaround: Send a message to yourself, and this will checkpoint.
