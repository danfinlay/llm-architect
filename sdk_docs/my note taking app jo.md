- At some point I started taking tons of notes, mostly just Apple notes. this worked fine, and I was really effective at it, because a simple search field could search through the text content of all of my notes.
- eventually, I started finding that I sometimes wanted to manage more complicated tasks than were easy to keep track of in Apple notes. I started looking for a solution that allowed having tasks with checked status, and I also wanted some thing that would support subtasks, so I started looking for a solution that supported some sort of recursive note type. This led me to [[Workflowy]], which I enjoyed for a couple years. I still think it’s the most performant recursive block note taking app. 
- eventually, I heard of roamresearch, and right away, it made a lot of sense to me. Coming from Workflowy, I had become frustrated by the experience of always having to categorize every note that I took (Like, should a meeting on a topic be in the meeting block or that topic’s block?). The opportunity to keep context for the notes that would be seamlessly interconnected with all of the other relevant notes was too good to miss. To this day, I keep avid notes in [[Roam Research]].
