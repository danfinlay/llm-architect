- A Hulu drama starring [[Jeff Bridges]], [[John Lithgow]], and [[Alia Shawkat]]
- Involves a group of CIA operatives and their entangled pasts related to the Soviet-Afghan war.
- Has strong themes related to
    - names
        - Multiple characters insist that names don't mean anything.
        - Each time a person learns a new name, there is a major revelation, emphasizing how the name represents a different relationship they had to someone else, like a [[pet name]].
    - perspective
        - Characters multiple times have to grapple with whether they were the one in control of a situation, or whether they were somewhat caught up as a pawn in someone else's story.
    - [[a third, more complicated thing]]
        - It was a major meme this year, and was also a recurring line in this show. Repeatedly people reject simple dualities that are presented to them, and then explain richer stories that give context and background to someone else's perception.
- Those major themes interweave in an interesting way. This feels like a great exemplar of a new kind of drama. If Breaking Bad was the exemplar of the anti-hero, where we watch white men corrupt into compelling villains, this new era is more marked by repeated de-centering of the story through additional context. Each time you think you have a grasp of the story well enough to know who the hero is, and whose story it is, there is some more information from someone else's perspective that enriches the situation, gives you sympathy for their own story, and leaves you uneasy about settling on your own stories about yourself or anyone else.
- Notable moments
    - "You don't control how you're remembered, the rememberers do that"
    - Lithgow is told that his adopted son was sharing him as his hero for a school assignment, and another child objected, saying he was a police officer and wasn't a suitable hero. Who did he choose? "Spider man"
        - Emphasizes that while the characters depicted here may be far from what we traditionally label as heroes, they at least resemble realistic struggles that are much closer to what we might ever have to endure, and they take on these struggles with lots of their own care and passion. It's hard to leave this and find a character that isn't worthy of being labeled a hero from their own perspective, even up against spider man.
