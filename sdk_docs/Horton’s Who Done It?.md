- High-level summary by [[Dan Finlay]]
    - Horton is a protocol for capability transfer in which a grantor of a capability is notified when a capability is being delegated, with a [[proposed name]] for that new delegate by the delegator. #[[delegation]]
    - Since Horton involves someone already granted a capability providing extra insight into how they are internally operating, it has a few peculiar characteristics.
        - It relies on a delegate expressing some of its internal operation, and invites the grantor to express preferences for or against individual approaches.
        - Since the delegator is claiming their own delegation, it could just as well be a [[scapegoat]], and actually reflect poorly on the delegator themselves.
    - Examples
        - "I'm taking your car to Al's car shop, let me know if you're ever unhappy with their service."
        - "The food tonight was provided by Mimi's catering services." (the host still chose the caterer)
