- [[[[endo]] [[LavaMoat]] Call]]
    - [[[[ses-shim]] red team]] report
        - Add mid-level "how we approached this" section
        - Discuss the challenges of securing the language at a mid-level
        - Add prompts for future research
        - Direct links to any tooling
            - Aaron's Eslint rule
            - The branch where Matthieu explored the hypothetical vulnerable change
    - How do you take several modules, and parameterize them so they can be used in many ways?
        - Common approaches
            - Dynamic scoping
            - Fluid
            - [[Mark Miller]]: Localized scoping: It's as if you instantiated the compartment as if you lexically scoped those modules.
                - There will be a `setEnv()` function.
                    - If there's no process, I'll create one with this property.
                    - If there's already one with no ENV, I'll assign this property.
                - `process.ENV` is available in node already and will be available in [[endo]] for any compartments that have it set.
                - MarkM: We need a lower-level env that is two-argument, like "set environment variable OF"
                    - Alice creates bob's compartment
                    - She then uses `setEnv` on his compartment global
                    - She then sets his compartment in motion.
                    - We may want something like a process.env shim, which sets it up if it doesn't exist already.
            - The [[endo]] zip archive feature is now passing all (current) tests and is in review.
                - Still has smoothing that has to go!
    - Maybe a [[[[ses-shim]] red team]] part 2 for [[ERTP]]/[[Zoe]]?
        - Targets:
            - the eventual-send layer, and help developers surface errors when they are using that layer.
        - Sushi: Hashiri is supposedly the most expensive sushi place, notes [[Jessy Irwin]]
    - [[Moddable SDK]] update
        - Now running [[lockdown]], and has created a [[purify]] function
    - Next [[TC-39]] Security Reflector call
