    - Summary
        - A wallet holds your authority so you can exercise it wherever you go. We can call this [[[[authority]] management]]

- Bitcoin impact
    - It was now possible to be in control of your own financial authority if you could keep a secret.
    - Payments were no longer prone to censorship.
    - Currency was decoupled from any single government's manipulation.
    - The decentralized wallet was born, and it had money.
- Ethereum impact
    - Anyone can create new currencies.
    - Anyone can create new NFTs.
    - Anyone can create new organizations, contracts, sets of rules.
    - The decentralized wallet could represent any digital rights!
        - Displaying more asset types became an important task, which we have still only scratched the surface of.
        - Displaying transactions became an important task, which we still have only scratched the surface of.
        - Accounts could now split up authority into multi-sig contracts, and more, and we've still only scratched the surface of how to expose that.
- Adoption impact
    - Transaction costs became too high for many use cases.
    - Resources poured into increasing the throughput.
    - Eth2, previously intended to address scaling, eventually yielded that task to "layer 2" solutions.
    - To enable scaling, wallets now need to support adding additional ledgers.
    - Some of the new ledgers use new novel cryptography
        -  ([[Starkware]], [[zk Sync]], [[Loopring]], [[zk STARKs]], etc.), and so the entire runtime of Ethereum is no longer enough for some Ethereum-based scaling strategies.
        - This implies that Ethereum-based wallets __need to__ accommodate new forms of authority management.
        - If Ethereum-based wallets need to accommodate new forms of authority management, then a good Ethereum-based wallet might as well be designed to handle any form of digital authority at all.
- Lessons from our experience
    - Experiencing the many roles a wallet strives to play made us ask if a decentralized wallet could hope to aggregate all forms of digital authority.
    - Experiencing the exhaustion of trying to keep up with the endless rapid innovation taught us that this work was beyond any one team.
    - Experiencing the endless exuberance of the ecosystem taught us that the only team that can keep up with an innovator is the innovator themselves.
    - This caused us to ask if there was a way to permissionlessly extend the wallet, and invite the broader community in to help us build it.
    - This led us to a rich world of friends and research that was oriented around addressing the same issues of [[Secure UI]], at [[Agoric]], kicking off our [[LavaMoat]] and [[[[MetaMask]] Snaps]] projects.
- Conclusions
    - An ideal wallet lets a user manage their digital [[authority]] with [[informed consent]].
    - One form of digital authority is the power to run software and extend It on the user's own computer.
    - These things may seem different, but they are just different scales.
        - A wallet built on a closed platform will offer a limited ability to extend authority.
        - The wallet that allows a user to extend itself safely can be extended to allow the user to extend any of their [[power/capability]] externally as well.
            - This means that the problem of building an open digital wallet is also tightly related to the problem of building an open computer operating system.
        - When [[power/capability]] is shared in a dense enough network of [agents]([[agent]]), new kinds of opportunities emerge. Trust can be represented digitally and is as good as cash, in the phenomenon called [[social collateral]].
            - This can allow for [[perfect insurance]].
            - This can allow for efficient multi-hop, broad-reach [[peer to peer lending]].
            - This will inevitably enable countless things we can't even anticipate.
    - Building a wallet and choosing its defaults is also a form of authority, and by encouraging user experimentation and innovation on our wallet, we will also be able to draw from more ideas when composing our product defaults.
        - Some of these additions will be worthy of becoming defaults.
        - Most of these additions will be abandoned experiments.
        - Some of these will be small, ad-hoc tools that are only useful to a few people.
    - Building an extensible wallet is a behemoth task.
        - It will not be done quickly, and the only way we'll be able to get there is incrementally, while preserving the core values of the wallet as we go: enabling the most valuable usage we can at every step of the way. If we do it right, we will continuously be unlocking new categories of value for our users, and be easily funding ourselves to build the next stage, hopefully eventually enabling ourselves to give our users full, unrestricted access to their own digital powers.
