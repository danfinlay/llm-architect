- How to implememt [[incentive trees]] with [[Delegatable Eth]]
- Prerequisites
    - A delegatable currency, like [[WETHA]]
    - A referral fee [[[[caveat]] enforcer contract]]
        - terms
            - amount per call? percent of a parameter of the resulting tx?
                - flat amount seems easier for mvp but less flexible.
            - recipient address
            - referral fee: [[token vector]]
        - enforceCaveat function
            - attempt to transfer the given [[token vector]]
    - An invocation
        - Would be part of a batch that issues an allowance first
            - Forces us to record the allowance on chain before using it, which is slightly wasteful, 
            - Requires the token like [[WETHA]] allow “reifying” an allowance on chain in a way that allows drawing from it
                - but this allowance isn’t on the tonen, it’s on a different [[[[caveat]] enforcer contract]]. This one needs a way to know how to draw from that allowance.
                - May imply a neccesity to allow callers to include optional parameters to each [[[[caveat]] enforcer contract]]. This would be a breaking change to the [[Delegatable Eth]] interface.
