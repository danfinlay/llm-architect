- Currently just messing around to see what's possible on the browser as [aurigami-3](https://github.com/danfinlay/aurigami-3) (GitHub) using [[Greater Theory of Reactivity (GTOR)]] principles of modern-[[JavaScript]] style streaming to enable new kinds of async multi-party audio discourse.
- User stories
    - Recording a simple message
        - A user opens the app, sees a "Record button"
        - They tap record, see visual indication that it is recording.
        - They record a message, then click stop.
        - They are given a link they can share with others to listen to their recording.
    - Replying to a simple message
        - A user with a link to a recording can open it and listen to a recorded message.
        - While the message is playing, the user has a record button that corresponds to the current position of the playback.
        - At any point in the message, the user should be able to record an interstitial reply.
        - After recording their reply, the user should have a new link they can share that allows others to listen to the newly embellished audio.
    - Streaming listening
        - Broadcaster
            - A user opens the app 
            - A user opens the app, sees a "Record button" with a "share listen link" button next to it.
            - The user can share the listen link with others.
            - The user can tap record whenever they want.
            - They tap record, see visual indication that it is recording.
        - Early listener
            - A listener who has a link for a recording before it is in progress is shown a waiting room, and the playback begins when the recording begins.
        - Delayed listener
            - A listener who joins a link mid-recording will begin hearing the message from the beginning.

    - [Capturing audio to Audio Buffer](https://codepen.io/jamesseanwright/pen/jrmayR) working codepen: Allows storing audio as binary
        - Only allows converting to binary __after __ the recording has completed.
            - Can multiple recordings be queued up back to back (chunked) seamlessly?
    - [AudioBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBuffer): A short clip of audio data in memory with low-level access
    - [decoding an  AudioBuffer into an AudioSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/decodeAudioData), good for playing back
    - [MediaStream processing API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/streams/StreamProcessing.html#canvas-recording), the full browser mediastream API. A higher-level API than AudioBuffer, but used for actual playback/recording.
