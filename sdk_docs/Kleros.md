- A platform for decentralized [[arbitration]] in [[smart contract]]s on [[Ethereum]]
- https://kleros.io/about/
- Selects jurors based on a lottery based on staked [[PNK (token)]]
    - Jurors vote on the outcome
    - Minority jurors lose their stake to the majority jurors.
    - There is an appeal system that triggers a larger jury (2x+1).
- Criticism
    - By selecting jurors according to [[PNK (token)]], the right to arbitrate is up for sale to the highest bidder.
    - [[Robin Hanson]] says "in the old South, there's a saying that you'd better vote the way everyone else does." Picking token holders rather than random people will bias for people who are willing to play the [[Keynesian beauty contest]]
        - [[Federico Ast]] says that the appeal process complicates the game of playing this [[Schelling point]] game.
- Concept is based on work of [[Thomas Schelling]]
