    - Intro: What is [[Fission]]? by [[Boris Mann]]
    - [[User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN)]] [[FileCoin]] signer portion with [[Ben Bollen]]
        - "Ucan do secure key management in the browser"
        - What is a wallet?
            - A tradeoff of security & ease of use
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMetaMask%2FlMOcboNjXb.png?alt=media&token=d551baf1-0480-41cc-b1ff-be5b95e1300e)
                - MetaMask & [[WalletConnect]] as a pretty easy and pretty secure option.
                - "I doubt my mother would authorize a [[FileCoin]] upload with MetaMask" - [[Ben Bollen]]
                - Burner Wallet as "high ease, low security".
                    - Burner Wallet abstracts away signature confirmations entirely.
        - What does it mean to manage permissions on the web?
            - The [[Access Control List (ACL)]] is a well known way.
            - [[object capability (ocap)]] as an alternative appraoch
                - Can be a signed token like [[[[JSON]] Web Token (JWT)]] that grants the holder authority to act on an object.
            - "We need to combine these two mechanisms" because "blockchains are an [[Access Control List (ACL)]] because the holder of a key controls what a user can do"
        - [[w3c]] issued a mandate for browsers to improve the crypto API via [[Subtle Crypto]] API, including a method for "non exportable keys".
            - These keys only support RSA, and some elliptic curves, but not the curves we care about in blockchains, so these can't be used for modern blockchains.
        - [[Web Native File System (WNFS)]] based key generation & authorization by key sharing
            - Keys are stored in the [[Web Native File System (WNFS)]] file system.
            - Each directory has a decryption key associated with it.
            - If you have access to any directory, you have access to its children too.
            - Includes an ocap-style bearer token that grants permission to append to the filesystem.
            - Permissions and keychain are stored in user's private directory.
            - Recovering the root key recovers access to the whole file system.
            - Some kinds of attenuation can't be enforced by a bearer's token (key transfer) alone
                - Time limits
                - Revocations
                - Spending limits
        - "What's not there can't be stolen": Overcoming how Some kinds of attenuation can't be enforced by a bearer's token (key transfer) alone
            - Make the app-delegated private key worthless (by itself)
            - Use [[BLS]], which is supported in [[FileCoin]] already, for 2-of-2 signature aggregation.
            - You already are connecting to "a server" (like [[Infura]]) to transmit a transaction, now we are adding a [[UCAN Co-Signer]], which will only co-sign transactions that meet its user-specified [[attenuation]].
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMetaMask%2FIbWpc4PTIG.png?alt=media&token=de730464-fc46-4387-bfd4-cb7936945238)
            - You transmit your [[User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN)]] with the BLS-signed app key.
            - The cosigner submits the signatures via a [[Powergate]].

            - You have cosigner web service that co-signs according to the attenuation of the key, and this is what allows ocap attenuation to be used with a delegated key to a site.
                - If the cosigner is hacked, the attacker could bypass those attenuations.
            - Worked with [[Planetary Social]]
                - Has a native app that will be compatible with many of these things.
            - Questions
                - Does this actually reduce user confirmations? There is still an act of delegation.
                    - Not necessarily, but opens us up to a much more open-ended design space of what can be delegated.
                - Does a cosigner actually reduce the needs for a user-trusted signer or something.
                    - Not really! The user still needs to perform an act of delegation, and the co-signer still needs to be run in a trusted process, and that process could be run inside a wallet/signer.
                    - The [[UCAN Co-Signer]] could be used as a process within a wallet to enforce its own locally-assigned signing permissions.
                - Do you generate the keys in a standard/recoverable way, or is the key recovery entirely from the encrypted file system.
                    - Current architecture of [[Fission]] generates keys using the [[Subtle Crypto]] non-recoverable key generation, which means keys are not recoverable if you [[puddle]] them, but [[Brooklyn Zelenka]] is looking at other ways of letting users provide keys from other sources, or recover them in other ways.
