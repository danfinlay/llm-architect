        - I feel that cryptographic ocap is now possible, which addresses some use cases that classic object capabilities do not. Part of that I believe will be driven by Smart Signatures. Paper: http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/10/smarter-signatures-experiments-in-verifications/ Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9sbWKbfyJU Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherA/smart-signaturesexperiments-in-authentication-stanford-bpase-2018-final (transcript): http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-24-christopher-allen-smart-signatures/
        - I have been talking to two silicon designers about supporting the cryptographic composiblity required for cryptographic ocap.

            - Demonstrated that [[SAML]] based capabilities could emulate federated identity but much simpler.

        - website that lets you pay to listen to the whole song.
        - Uses [[Unlock Protocol]] on [[[[Gnosis]] chain]]
        - Allows connecting a crypto wallet
        - pay
            - xdai on gnosis chain not showing proper symbol!
    - app.unlock-protocol.com/keychain
        - lets you view your unlock [[NFT]]s.
    - upgradable proxy contract example: a Lock
        - [[[[EIP]] 721: NFT]] compatible contract
        - Has an expiration time
        - a beneficiary
        - transfer fees
        - hasRole
            - lock manager
                - deployer of contract, allows you to share control of the lock.
            - key granter
                - Allows additional people to issue NFTs
            - key manager: the true owner of the NFT
                - Allows lending an NFT, but allows [[revocation]]
                - `owner` of the ERC-721 is actually lower-authority
    - credit card NFT use case
        - You buy the NFT for a user
        - You throw away the issuing key
        - The user doesn't have gas
