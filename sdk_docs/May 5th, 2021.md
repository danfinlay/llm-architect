- [[Andy Wingo]] [has a talk](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/webassembly/) where he shows how to compile [[Racket]] into [[wasm]]
    - Inspired two additional approaches: https://github.com/Bogdanp/racket-wasm and https://github.com/pmatos/racket-binaryen the latter of which actually references Wingo's talk!
