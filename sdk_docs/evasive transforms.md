- A simple transform for the sake of keeping SES small, a mere heuristic approach to removing code that can have dangerous implications.
    - Because of
        - the `import.meta` expression
            - Only allowed in module code 
        - [[html-like comment]]s
            - `<!--` will allow comments within JS!
            - Successfully implemented everywhere.
            - In modules, this gets interpreted as a sequence of operators instead of as a comment.
- the censoring source code transforms and the [[evasive transforms]]
    - a [[ses-shim]] implementation drama
        - [link to source comment](https://github.com/Agoric/SES-shim/blob/bf06c3a4c97991b7377eba08af049c6d2ea64d31/packages/ses/src/transforms.js#L26-L52)
    - [[evasive transforms]]
        - invented for [[Kumavis]]'s convenience
    - Since [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]] is converting modules to scripts, it becomes uncertain whether or not the executing environment will interpret the [[html-like comment]].
    - When [[Mark Miller]] first wrote the censor for the [[html-like comment]], he expected the HTML parser would skip the text between the comment opening and closing comments.
        - Actually, if recognized, EITHER the closing or opening html-like comment is treated like a `//` comment, and so "the rest of the line is skipped".
    - To be extra-safe, now if [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]] ever sees those sequences of characters, it fully rejects that entire source code.
    - To reliably censor these things, [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]] uses [[RegExp]] to find these.
        - Catches some false positives, which is unfortunate.
            - template literals
            - within strings
            - more
    - The 8 magic lines cannot emulate a [[direct eval]], but can only do an [[indirect eval]]
