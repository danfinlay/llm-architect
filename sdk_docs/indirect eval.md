- A strange kind of [[JavaScript]] eval statement that allows accessing variables that come from a parent lexical scope.
- When [[eval]] is evaluated as a function, which causes it to be called with the global scope, not the lexical scope of the caller.
    - Direct eval: `let x = 10; eval(“x = 20”)`
    - Indirect eval: `const e = eval; e(“x = 10”)`

- Opposed to [[direct eval]]
