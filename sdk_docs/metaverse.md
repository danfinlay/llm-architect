- A poorly defined catch-all term that can mean anything from
    - A very specific vision of a shared virtual environment that we could come to live in, where there is a global policy of what exists in this world. A form of [[coordinated decentralization]]
        - Captured by one company?
            - [[Meta]]
        - Captured by one token/community?
            - [[Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)]]
            - [[Sandbox 3D]]
            - [[CryptoVoxels]]
            - [[Decentraland]]
    - The general interconnection of everything on the internet, in all of its messy glory. A form of [[loosely-coupled decentralization]]
        - The rules of this world could not be defined by any one platform, and so no company claiming to be building the metaverse is likely referring to this approach.
        - Many early descriptions of a user's [[web3]] [[wallet]] as "part of the metaverse" was probably referencing more of this experience: Collecting all sorts of digital goods from many different sources/authorities and carrying them with you in your wallet to anywhere else you go.
        - There could be many virtual environments in this vision, each with their own rules, even though items from different realms of authority may be able to move between those domains and interact.
        - [[Mark Miller]] has a talk from 1996 [[computer security and the future of the law]] where he describes the concept of entering a virtual space with its own rules, and what it might mean to enter a place where by entering you might have to abide by its terms. This is the earliest concrete description I have seen of this type of vision of a loosely-coupled decentralized 3D environment.
