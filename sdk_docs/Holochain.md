    - Notes
        - Highlights a schism in [[decentralized]] systems today
            - [[agent centric]]: Like [[git]]. Each agent freely empowered. Sounds equivalent to [[loosely-coupled decentralization]].
            - [[data centric]]. Like [[Bitcoin]]. Focused on establishing shared state. Sounds equivalent to [[coordinated decentralization]]
