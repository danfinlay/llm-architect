    - Notes
        - Opening presentation by [[Matt Garnett (lightclient)]]
            - They're really happy about its current status.
            - Main motivations: Sponsored txs
            - Other approaches
                - [[EIP 2612: DAI_v2 style permit()]]
                    - Just one method on one contract
                - [[[[EIP]] 2771]]
                    - Creates a trusted forwarder that new contracts need to agree on.
                    - Puts burden on contract producer.
            - Summary
            - Definitions
                - EOA
                - Sponsor (pays the gas fee)
                - Sponsee (wants a tx)
                - [[invoker]]
                - Callee
                    - The contract that is being sent a message by the sponsor.
        - My points
            - We've been eager to bring MetaTransactions to MetaMask for a while, but we've hit challenges.
                - Preserving backwards compatibility while adding new features.
                    - user accounts
                    - published smart contracts
            - Security
                - Delegation means the parent account should be safe, given correct behavior of the contracts they interact with.
                - "Correct behavior" here would more narrowly mean `msg.sender` becomes entirely reliable as a source of security.
                - Sponsors need to somewhat trust their sponsees, since a transaction could non-deterministically run out of gas, allowing griefing of the sponsor.
                    - I don't think this is a deal breaker, it's pretty much required for a MetaTransaction scheme.
                    - This can be mitigated by having the sponsee commit to refunding a sponsor in their delegation message.
            - {{embed: Use cases}}
            - Next steps
                - I'd be eager to have a 3074 testnet that people can try out.
                - MetaMask should make this much easier to play with soon, and we would be eager to invite the larger community to help design the best invokers.
