- It can seem like all of crypto is scams, and it's true that scammers are quick to see the potential value in selling... imaginary promises of thin air. But the underlying tech that lets people publish public digital promises can also be valuable for people in a wider set of uses.
- Unsavory uses of crypto
    - These may not be all flat-out unethical in all cases, but I'm going to just lay out a bunch of the ways that people are kinda degrading the utility of crypto long term. The more we rely on these effects, the longer it will take for actually sustainable mechanisms to emerge.
    - [[ponzi scheme]]s
        - Many major crypto communities today amount to ponzi-type schemes. They're a bit better than the schemes of Madoff or Cutco Knife type MLMs, since anyone can exit at any time, but ultimately the success of those in the network depends on getting more people in the network, and I think that's what most people mean when when they say ponzi scheme today.
        - Ponzis have made quite a few people madly rich, but it also is toxic as hell, can degrade others' trust and respect in you, and because it constantly leeches off new capital, it is fundamentally unsustainable. These projects are just waiting for a whale or two to exit to send the house of cards crashing down.
        - Don't push your friends to buy things you're holding. Friends don't try to capitalize on their friends.
- Types of ethical crypto usage
    - Protocol tokens
        - Odds are, if you're reading this, you aren't writing a new crypto protocol, but it's worth noting that some protocols depend on having some kind of token that allocates the power in that system. The catch is, how do you distribute that power fairly? [[Ethereum]] today still catches occasional flack for its initial distribution, but how might you do better?
    - Crowd funding
        - Banks and traditional investors won't fund everything that deserves funding. The people who are best positioned to know if you're being honest when you raise funds are the people who are closest to you.
        - One of the best achievements of web2 was the proliferation of peer to peer fundraising. Today those technologies are gated by tight policies, and not everyone can get listed on Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Crypto lets anyone decide for themselves if they'd like to take on the journey of crowdfunding.
        - Depending how this is done, crowdfunding with crypto may be considered a security, and so you need to consider the legality of your approach yourself.
        - Like Kickstarter, if you fund someone in crypto, you don't really have any insurance if they don't keep their word, so you have to be careful about who you give your money to.
    - Gift cards
    - Shared budgeting
        - If you're using crypto to give to others, you're certainly not personally performing an unethical act. I can't promise you aren't being taken advantage of, though, that's for you to decide.
