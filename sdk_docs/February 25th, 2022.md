    - Notes
        - [[propagator]]s
            - constraint based systems
            - massively parallel
            - friendly to [[partial information]]
            - A subset is guaranteed to converge

                - [[We Don't Know How to Compute ([[Gerrald "Jerry" Sussman]])]]
                    - When you say something that doesn't make sense to me, I don't crash, I chuckle.
                - [[strangeloop conference]] Sept 19-20 2011
                    - Observing how modeling a circuit diagram in computers is weirdly hard, and should be bidirectional.
            - Friendly to [[CapTP]]
            - Components
                - Cells
                    - information or partial information
                    - Pushes information to propagators
                - Propagators
                    - Gathers information from cells, and spits out to cells.
            - [[Alexey Radul]] wrote on [[propagator]]s, emphasizing how partial information can be accumulated towards

            - [[Software Design for Flexibility]]
            - Building height problem
                - Compared to shadow of a barometer
                - Compared to barometric pressure
                - Measured against fall time
                    - Increased precision propagates precision to the barometer, helping calibrate it.
            - [[Leilani Gilpin]]
        - Solving problems
            - Narrowing down a crime: 
        - Examples that could apply to MetaMask
            - names for things
            - whether something is a phisher
            - what is true?
                - who is claiming what?
