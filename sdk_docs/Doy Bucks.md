- At the end of the two weeks, there are a couple special events
    - A student-run flea market, where students bring old toys and things they don't want, are able to rent space to set up shop in, and sell their wares for doy bucks.
    - An auction hosted by the school. The final opportunity to spend the doy bucks, and so would have some big-ticket items near the end, to ensure students are excited to save up their bucks for this event.
- Was a totally beloved event by the students, one of the most anticipated events of the year.
- Tended to create a whole alternative economy for the duration of the experiment, where kids would hire each other for various things and even gamble on games.
- Each bill was lovingly illustrated by [[Bob Whitlow]] with a family of cartoons he called [[Doys]].
    - The illustrations seem to take inspiration from MAD magazine
