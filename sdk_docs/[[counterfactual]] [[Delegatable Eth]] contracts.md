- Idea for [[[[counterfactual]] [[Delegatable Eth]] contracts]] addition for getting a little closer to the [[Counterfactual WebCap Wallet]] dream, by allowing delegating to a counterfactaully published contract
- Context
    - [[Delegatable Eth]] can only delegate to an [[externally owned account (EOA)]] today.
    - I have a general notion that a [[caveat]] could be constructed that allowed delegating to a multisig, or set of token holders, for example.
    - Furthermore
        - It would be nice to be able to deploy counterfactual delegatable-wrapper contracts for existing contracts.
            - a [[EIP 2612: DAI_v2 style permit()]] contract could sign an allowance to a wrapper contract that anyone could publish, and so with no transactions, its permissions could be extended transitively.
            - For regular on-chain allowance types, a single tx to grant the allowance to the counterfactual address could allow this.
- Proposed approaches
    - A delegation message could include some kind of counterfactual contract-deploying commitment.
    - Let the counterfactual contract account handle itself, and rely on our contractInvoke method to redeem its permissions. 
        - IF the contract account is itself delegatable
            - each signer could be delegated
            - What would it take for the contract itself to issue a [[counterfactual delegation message]]
                - is there a way it might already work?
                    - If each signer signed an equivalent delegation to the recipient 
                        - in a [[n of m multisig]], recipient could then sign within the approved constraints on behalf of each signer.
                        - in a [[token-weighted vote]], recipient could cast votes within the approved [[attenuation]]
- Goals
    - A delegation could be signed for an m of n of some group of recipients, even if that group had no contract account published prior to receiving this delegation.
    - The commitment should only publish if that contract is not on chain already
    - If the recipient multisig logic is stateless, no state should be necessarily deployed persistently to the chain.
    - The address for the recipient should be deterministic
        - Multiple delegations to the same contract could rely on the same state.
        - Deterministic components
            - the code to deploy / init_code
            - the deployer factory
            - salt
                - to allow this instance to be a singleton.
        - Almost certainly using [[[[EIP]] 1014: CREATE2]]
- Current delegation shape
- Playing with necessary alternatives
