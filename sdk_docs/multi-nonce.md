- A strategy of transaction [[replay protection]] by [[Pisa Research]] first described [in this article and hackathon entry](https://github.com/PISAresearch/metamask-comp).
- [An implementation](https://github.com/anydotcrypto/metatransactions/blob/for-audit/src/contracts/account/ReplayProtection.sol) in [[Solidity]]
- There are two dimensions to a nonce
    - Row
    - Transaction Number
- Each rowâ€™s transactions must be executed in order, but there may be an arbitrary number of rows, allowing highly parallelized transaction queues.
- Would need to be supported at the contract-account level, like in a fork of [[[[Gnosis]] SAFE]], as its strategy for replay protection.
    - [Opened as an issue](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/issues/239) there.
