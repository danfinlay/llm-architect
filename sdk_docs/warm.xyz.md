- An [[NFT]] [[delegation]] framework for [[evm]].
- Very similar to [[Delegate.cash]]
- Requires third parties to "respect the connection".
    - Can you delegate to many recipients, ie have infinite virtual cryptopunk holders?
- Doesn't seem to allow the delegate to __do__ anything with the NFT, other than "proving ownership".
