- Builds on  [[Trust and social collateral: 2007 (Mobius, Szeidl)]]
- Formally defines a type of safe and scalable social network.
    - No agent lends more to another than you value the relationship.
        - More correctly, this should probably be You must not lend more to another than that other values your relationship
            - This is similar to [[the platinum rule]], in that it takes the other's perspective into account.
            - This is definitely harder to approximate, and since it incorporates an estimate of another's values, it emphasizes subjectivity and the need for safety by under-estimating this value.
- Demonstrates how networks of [[social collateral]] connections compose via [[maximal flow]].
- Proves several safety properties of this type of lending network.
    - Side-deal proof equilibrium
        - Means you cannot bribe people in a social collateral network to betray each other.
        - Intuition
            - If a person only lends to others who value their relationship at a greater level, then the loan is effectively under-collateralized, and repayment is valued highly by the borrower.
            - If the borrower values repayment more than the asset borrowed, then there is no amount they can be bribed to betray the lender that they would not put towards repayment.
            - For this reason, any external agent trying to incentivize betrayal would be more likely to have their bribe absorbed and shared among the network's participants than actually lead to corruption.
    - Coalition proof
        - While small dense networks have advantages of high trust, new [[connector]] bridges to other networks can enable entirely new opportunities.
        - A social collateral graph is size-agnostic, and so can bridge the advantages of dense coalitions with disparate connections in an organic and continuous topology.
- Demonstrates a variety of contexts in which social collateral organically operates
    - A shipowner receiving repairs in a foreign port.
