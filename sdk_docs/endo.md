- A distributed [[Secure EcmaScript (SES)]] runtime being developed largely by [[Kris Kowal]] at [[Agoric]].
    - Named after [[Node.js]], but is a variation of that type of runtime, extended to realize the goals of [[Secure Distributed JavaScript]]
- Needing a slogan. Candidates:
    - "A node for distributed secure objects" - [[Mark Miller]]
    - Not node, deno, nor done. - [[Kris Kowal]]
    - [[Dan Finlay]] tries
        - A JavaScript runtime for simple distributed security.
- Latest form: [[[[endo]] pet daemon]]
- [Milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/endojs/endo/milestones)
- Builds on the determinsitic, resumable [[SwingSet]].
    - Current version does not have [[orthogonal persistence]].
- Will enable mashups of entire infrastructure stacks, from front-end, to back-end, to state itself.
- Inter-process authentication
    - Probably will ship with some base "bare minimum" cryptography to allow secure distributed objects, but with room to parameterize any endo environment with a different consensus/authentication system so that it can be extended to support arbitrary reference distribution strategies. #VatTP
- Could eventually be extended to include [[metering]].
- “Endo ends where [[blockchain]] begins.” - [[Kris Kowal]]

- https://github.com/Agoric/SES-shim/issues/517
- Security policy
    - Will allow running scripts with limited permissions.
    - Will incorporate [[LavaMoat]] for managing [[dependency]] confinement policy.
- Will not have persistence in the MVP, and adding it would complicate the [[determinism]] virtue of the system.
