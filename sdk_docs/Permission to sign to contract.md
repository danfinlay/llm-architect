- A concept for a using [[[[EIP]] 191]] type `0` signatures to enable a coherent [[permission]].

- Motivation
    - Confirmations should be minimized to the amount that is reasonable per the [[principle of appropriate boundaries]].
    - Type `0` signatures allow signatures to be restricted to the execution of a given contract.
    - Since the given contract can be immutable, any one specified contract can be audited and known and named, and responsibility for displaying the meaning of signatures intended for it can be safely reviewed, and treated as an immutable standard.
    - Standards that are JS-only are prone to shifting EIPs, inconsistent implementations, etc. Keeping the interpretation immutable on a blockchain is a perfect way to keep clients bound to a shared truth.
- Proposal
    - For protocols that involve off-chain signatures, define an on-chain contract to interpret them, even for other contracts.
    - Other contracts can now rely on the interpretation of this signature interpreter (similar to an [[invoker]] per [[[[EIP]] 3074: Delegated Invocation Contracts]]).
    - Wallets can then standardize around the display of the new signature format, which can have arbitrarily specific ideal display format, as long as it's implied that it's rigidly enforced by the [[invoker]].
    - Can enable clean, well confined delegation of specific powers to another script in contact with the signer.
        - Permission to sign methods that can interact with `CONTRACT IDENTITY`.
            - The invoker's purpose needs to be respected by contracts that would receive messages from this invoker. Choosing a good boundary for this purpose is a critical choice for invoker designers.
            - An example of a good boundary might be for a contract itself: When connecting to a site, you might actually trust it to silently sign messages related to a specific smart contract.
