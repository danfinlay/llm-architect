- Austrian-British [economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist) and [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher) who is best known for his defence of [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism). Hayek shared the 1974 [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences) with [Gunnar Myrdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Myrdal) for his "pioneering work in the [theory of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_economics) and [economic fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle) and [...] penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek#cite_note-1) His account of how [changing prices communicate information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_signal) that helps individuals co-ordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics, leading to his Nobel Prize.
- “I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can't take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can't stop."

-Hayek 1984
