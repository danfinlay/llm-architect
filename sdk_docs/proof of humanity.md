- An [[Ethereum]] based [[dapp]] that aspires to create a [[sybil resistance]] registry of all humans, and give them a [[UBI]] by [[Santiago Siri]]

- Process
    - Anyone can apply for membership
        - Includes staking 0.15 ether
        - Includes a video testimonial of uniqueness
    - Any already-registered human can "vouch" for a pending application.
    - After a vouch, there is a 3 day open challenge period. Challenges are arbitrated by [[Kleros]]
        - If the challenge is accepted
            - the application is rejected
            - the person who vouched loses their membership
                - Does the person who vouched for them also lose their membership? If so, how far up the invitation tree?
        - If the challenge is rejected, it is dismissed
    - If no successful challenges after 3 days, the person is accepted into the registry, and they receive their ether deposit back.
    - All members in the registry continuously receive a [[UBI]] of [[UBI (token)]]
    - People can be challenged after they've been accepted, as well.
