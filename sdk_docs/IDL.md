    - **IDL**, short for **Interactive Data Language**, is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) used for [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).  It is popular in particular areas of science, such as [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy), [atmospheric physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_physics) and [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging).[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__] IDL shares a common [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_%28programming_languages%29) with [PV-Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PV-Wave) and originated from the same [codebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase), though the languages have subsequently diverged in detail. There are also [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) or [costless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware) implementations, such as [GNU Data Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Data_Language) (GDL) and [Fawlty Language](http://www.flxpert.hu/fl/) (FL).
