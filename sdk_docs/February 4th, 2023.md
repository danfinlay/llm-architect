- [[demand side aggregation]] is discovery for the buy-side. How can we find what someone would pay for? from [[Vinay Gupta]]
    - Could represent an [[object capability (ocap)]] to redeem payment in exchange for providing the service requested.
    - Similar to [[offer safety]]
    - Requires some trusted intermediary to do the final reconciliation between the thing desired and the payment requested. Could benefit from either a central 3rd party, or a more dynamic [[social collateral]] solution like [[The Simplest Trustworthy Oracle]].
