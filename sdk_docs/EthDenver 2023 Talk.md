    - "All i know is that I donâ€™t know nothing" - Operation Ivy
    - applications in decentralization 
        - sourcing trustworty software (software supply chain)
        - sourcing trustworthy info (oracles)
        - phishing risk
        - rug risk
        - contract bug risk
- A brief intro to what it is
    - Some basic observations
        - We want to do ambitious things quickly.
        - We want to minimize our risk.
        - Blockchains as digital loss
            - blockchains are only really needed when someone is __losing__ access to an ability, like sending __away__ a token, but you can gain a lot of scalability in situations where access is being expanded.
        - Blockchains as supreme court
            - Blockspace is expensive
            - We should pursue architectures that facilitate keeping as much as possible off-chain.
    - A solution to a basic problem
        - Minimizing risk
    - "Off-chain delegation for on-chain actions: Delegatable allows users to approve 3rd-parties to act on their behalf. Delegations can be revoked, scoped, or limited to meet the unique needs of your protocol or app and keep users in control" - [[Ben Mills]]
