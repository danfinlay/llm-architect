            - Discussing the pet names paper
            - Someone showed the MetaMask interface
            - Mark's eyes bugged out of his head and he said "this is too good, I HAVE to attack this!"
        - Where does [[MetaMask]] intersect with [[Agoric]] and [[Spritely]]?

                    - Japan
                        - Agree on every frame, add lag for consistency
                    - US style
                        - Sacrifice consensus for performance, and then replay the behaviors to conclude eventual state.
                    - What happens under a conflict?
                        - Agree on a turn order, so the replay is deterministic on both sides.
                - "If you have 5 machines validating txs for a bank, but users want lower latency, the same logic can apply."
                - ## If you're snapshotting after every turn, you can extend this machine to have an arbitrary consensus protocol.
                    - require m of n confirmations to acknowledge each next message on the queue.
                - You can take an E-style vat, and simply layer these and get a quorum for free.
