- A simple goal: Let people use computers safely but in an open-ended way. Represent authority as a kind of [divisible]([[principle of appropriate boundaries]]) and [attenuable]([[attenuation]]) object that can be created, transmitted and shared freely.
    - I believe this is an important goal to enabling society to evolve more seamlessly, per [[digital [[social collateral]]]].
- Longest term: A user's primary computer (used for managing their authority) should be architected in a way that is optimized for [[rich sharing]].
- Today, we have many architectures, mostly [[Access Control List (ACL)]]s. They are not very flexible, and most computers grant excess authority to every application/site visited.
- Challenges
    - People have things they need done today, nobody has the patience to start from zero for a new project.
    - Different layers of the stack have different costs to innovate at (hardware is more expensive than software, custom silicon is maybe the most expensive).
- Therefore
    - We need solutions that can be iteratively rolled out, demonstrated, and provide value at each phase.
        - Phases I have in mind
            - [[[[MetaMask]] Snaps]]
