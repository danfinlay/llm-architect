    - [[permission]] vs [[authority]]
        - A distinction intended to bring strong distinctions between a variety of security terms. Mark sees these as two sides of a fundamental dichotomy. Isn't married to the words themselves, but sees the concepts as essential.

            - Sidebar: Privilege, Permission, and Authority
            - The security community often refers to the Principle of Least Privilege [4]. However,
            - exactly what constitutes a privilege isn’t clear. One attempt at a definition [5] introduces
            - the distinction between permission and authority. The authors define permission to be
            - the set of rules as written down, say in an access control list, and authority to be the set of
            - actions a process can cause to happen. The latter combines the set of permissions with
            - the behavior of parties having these permissions.
            - Consider a web server. The process running the server has permission to read the files of
            - the web site; there is a specific entry in the ACL for each file. Someone visiting the web
            - site has no entry in the ACL but still can read the contents of the file because the server
            - presents the information. Hence, the visitor has authority to read the files even though
            - there is no explicit permission granting the access.
            - Security analysis that considers only permission will be incomplete. Security analysis
            - that includes authority is necessarily limited by our ability to understand the behavior of
            - programs. Fortunately, it is often possible to get a usable bound on the authority
            - available to any process [5].
        - Definitions
            - Permission
                - The rights you're given by the underlying primitives of the security system.
                - The fundamental capabilities that are connecting all other side-effects.
                - A [[object capability (ocap)]] "capability" __is__ a permission under this definition.
            - Authority
                - Those things you can actually do as a result of the composition of the permissions and the permitted actions of other parties.
                - The ultimately delegated and composed results of all permissions and underlying delegations.
                - My impression
                    - Includes behavioral limitations of the actors receiving some permission.
                    - Includes subsequent references that may be passed along initially established permissions.
