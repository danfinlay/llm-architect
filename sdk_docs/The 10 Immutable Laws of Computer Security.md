    - Law #1: If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it's not solely your computer anymore.
        - This is exactly what we aim to remedy with [[principle of least authority (POLA)]]
    - Law #2: If a bad guy can alter the operating system on your computer, it's not your computer anymore.
    - Law #3: If a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore.
    - Law #4: If you allow a bad guy to run active content in your website, it's not your website any more.
    - Law #5: Weak passwords trump strong security.
    - Law #6: A computer is only as secure as the administrator is trustworthy.
    - Law #7: Encrypted data is only as secure as its decryption key.
    - Law #8: An out-of-date antimalware scanner is only marginally better than no scanner at all.
    - Law #9: Absolute anonymity isn't practically achievable, online or offline.
    - Law #10: Technology is not a panacea.
