- [[Roam Research]] ideas
    - Individual graphs are the right starting points, as any "consistent view" or [[actor]] is going to at least embody a single synchronous state.
    - It's even great how styling and extension happens at the graph level, means each graph can come to have its won personal identity, and I think the concept of extensibility (like the Roam Depot) is a fine direction (though I have concerns about the [[Roam Depot]] security model).
    - What sucks is the sharing permissions.
        - The "share by page" feature is a joke (if enabled, the API dumps your entire db to anyone who knows its name).
        - What it needs is more granular permissions (share read/write)
            - There is some ambiguity about what is shared with a "block" (links? transitive embedded references?)
                - I think it makes sense to borrow a bit from [[object capability (ocap)]] and treat it like an object reference graph: Access to a link or embed endows access to that content as well. Then leave it to people to learn how to build in a way that is conducive to this intuitive way to achieve the [[principle of appropriate boundaries]], creating units of sharing that always facilitate the 
            - It's both important that people sharing a graph are able to express it in whatever way they like and for the recipients of this access to be safe from unreasonable risks, or at least from any risks they didn't agree to.
                - This is part of why the script system needs to be able to transmit with the graph: Access to a graph page could itself embed in it a secret access token, which allows not just loading the content on the block, but calling an external API, and attempting to perform some totally external action. These actions can include retrieving information, or just making things happen (y'know, functions).

- New [[game idea]]: [[Sound a round]]. Someone starts by adding a layer to the loop, and you go in a circle adding something to it, until someone says stop.

    - You submit your address, and they keep changing who that means they share it with!
    - Just loses your personal control of that information.
