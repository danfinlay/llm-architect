- A local name for another [[agent]]/entity.
- Examples
    - Address book
    - browser bookmarks
- By having a user add labels for other entities, the computer system can present that user with that name whenever that entity is encountered, making it a valuable security tool in a [[permissionless]] security context, where external entities can be created and may need to be interacted with faster than any central name registry can be updated.
- Can include the ability to share these names, and subscribe to others' declarations of these names, forming a sort of [[web of [[trust]]]].

- Doesn't need to be confined to names. Pretty much any attestation can follow this pattern.
    - profile pictures
    - descriptions of something
    - phishing warnings
    - blocklists
- The user interface should make a distinction between
    - A user's own name for an entity (a pet name, the most trusted kind of name)
    - An entity's name for itself ([[self [[proposed name]]]])
        - Must be shown with additional suspicion.
    - An entity's proposed name for a third party ([[proposed name]])
        - Can be shown as a sort of attribution, especially if the proposer is someone the user has a concrete name for.
