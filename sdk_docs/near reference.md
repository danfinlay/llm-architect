- the form of reference familiar from conventional sequential non- distributed object programming. A near reference is a local reference to a resolved target. In other words, a near reference starts and ends in the same vat, and it knows which target object it should deliver messages to. A near reference conveys both immediate-calls and eventual-sends, providing full authority to invoke its target. Only near references convey immediate-calls, so objects in one vat may not immediate- call objects in another vat. Thus, each turn implicitly has mutually exclusive access to all state to which it has synchronous access. No explicit locks are needed or allowed.
