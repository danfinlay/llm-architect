- a vat-crossing reference to a resolved target. So long as its target’s vat is reachable, a far reference conveys eventual-sends to its target. A far reference thereby provides only the authority to enqueue pending deliveries in its target’s vat’s queue, to be delivered to its target in separate isolated turns. An eventual-send is non-blocking—the sender cannot block its vat’s thread waiting for a response. Thus, conventional deadlocks cannot occur.
