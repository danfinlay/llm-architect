- A property of a [[programming language]] with [[orthogonal persistence]] where function references passed over an [[async [[membrane]]]] like via [[CapTP]] are restored after a crash or service disruption.
- What is lost on a crash or partition?
    - [[E (Language)]] mistake
        - A [[manually persistent]] process should not release a message from  a non-committed state.
        - ie, if Vat A is [[manually persistent]], 
        - When Alice sends a message to Carol, Vat A should engage in manual persistence of the Vat A state from which Vat A decided to send the message, and only after the message is committed to is the message released.
        - [[E (Language)]] therefore had [[hangover inconsistency]]
        - Types of message given a failure
            - Mere messages: Lost on partition
            - [[sturdy references]]: Should be delivered even given a partition & reconnect. They carry messages, but in a reliable manner.
                - The sender should retry forever until they receive acknowledgement.
                - The recipient should not acknowledge until it has itself committed to the receipt.
    - [[Waterken]] had distributed [[orthogonal persistence]]
