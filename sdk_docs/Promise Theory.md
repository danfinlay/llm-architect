- A type of system comprehension promoted by [[Mark Burgess]]
- [[Dan Finlay]] saw the syntax and use of [[Granovetter diagram]]s as a similar type of structural analysis to the type common in [[object capability (ocap)]]s, and started [a thread to that effect](https://groups.google.com/g/cap-talk/c/8QRixUhzcyM/m/PGP3uX4tCwAJ) on [[cap-talk]]
    - [[Alan Karp]] noted he felt the similarity is superficial, that a capability is a true permission, and a promise is an agreement.
        - Dan thinks this is a false dichotomy: 
            - Even a capability is just a promise. A key seems like a sure thing til the lock breaks, til the car wonâ€™t start. Promises might actually be the closest thing we ever hold to a [[power/capability]].
            - A meal might seem filling but be spoiled, a coffee might seem satisfying but be decaf. The needs we have are the yardsticks of the promises we redeem, and we only guess the value of the promises we hold.
