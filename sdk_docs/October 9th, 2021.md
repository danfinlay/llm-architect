    - [[terms of entry]]
    - [[vat]] evolution
        - [[lambda calculus]] + state, combined with [[The Actor Model]] leads to [[vat]]s
        - Two dimensions to a [[vat]]
            - The message queue (from [[The Actor Model]])
            - the async injection stack
        - [[Dean Tribble]] combined these
            - Messages can be directed to different objects.
        - object vs actor
            - object within a vat give you the model for changing state within the vat
        - Don't use "Actor" to refer to what we're making, because it lacks a stack.
    - [[Facebook]] at congress
        - Seem to be pursuing some form of sanctioned censorship.
    - [[ScoopFS]] was sold as [[two click sharing]]
    - Selling Ocaps
        - easy sharing for the end user
            - [[Alan Karp]] prefers to advocate sharing over [[delegation]], since many people perceive delegation as a negative!
                - I tend to perceive delegation as a fundamental right of having any power, and would like to believe this is a winnable debate.
        - local sensibility: be yourself in your own contexts
        - [[Mark Miller]]
            - "If you lower the cost of cooperation, you get a more cooperative world"
        - Responsibility tracking for enterprise
        - Portability
            - no lock-in
            - For the anyone who has been disenchanted
            - Lower the cost to compete against entrenched monopolies.
        - Composability
        - Privacy
            - Allow users to manage their own policy
        - Why do you need [[EQ]]
        - Breaking people out of what they think is possible today
            - No need for passwords
            - "Don't prohibit what you can't prevent": We do not claim to prevent what we cannot.
                - [[Mastodon]] repeatedly told users they could keep some things safe & private that were later proven not to be.
        - Help avoid accidental authority mistakes, like via [[admonition system]] or [[voluntary oblivious compliance]].
        - Actually realizing the truly decentralized web potential (some thoughts by [[Dan Finlay]])
            - Users as the source of all of their data, but with the ability to freely replicate and rebroadcast anything they have access to.
            - No need for any central authority: Neither name system nor administrator; each user the source of authority for all of their own resources.
            - Handoffs: Despite computation being rooted on each user's computer, handoffs under the hood allow resilient networking that allows users to operate at the intuitive layer while benefiting from resilient networking.
            - The interface and programming model both maintains a maximally simple conceptual model, which allows easy sharing and portable composition.
            - A caution by Mark Miller
                - The way we program here may be similar to [[object oriented programming]], but it is different. [[programming with [[object capability (ocap)]] style]]
    - [[(Internet Identity Workshop) IIW]] meetings
        - Is popular to say "own your data"
    - [[admonition system]]
- [[graph viz]]
