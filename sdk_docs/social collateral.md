- The notion that since people value their relationships, they can entrust others with things of value in a way that resembles using the relationship as [[collateral]].
- Not only can people entrust others with things, but that trust is also transitive, and your trust in a person is equal to the sum of all the things they trust, including other [[agent]]s they may give access to what you give them.
- When an asset is lost (or a [[power/capability]] is drained) that was given on the social collateral principle, the lender is faced with a decision: to either agree with the usage of the asset (forgive), or lose faith in the borrower (resent). A long chain of delegations can trigger a series of such reviews, which I'm calling the [[[[social collateral]] dance]].
- There has been game theoretical research that shows large resilient lending networks can be built as long as each agent respects [[the [[social collateral]] principle]].
    - You must not lend more to another than that other values your relationship
- This kind of trust is transitive, so it can be delegated, allowing a chain or network of trust, often called "[[vouching]] for someone".
- Through digital facilitation, networks of delegated trust could enable larger graphs of [[digital [[social collateral]]]] than could ever be possible through organic/physical social networks.

            - Here we see how social collateral isn't only measured in monetary units. It can also be measured in an amount of possible misery. If a member of a conspiracy is facing jail time, how much jail time are they willing to take to preserve their relationships? [[fear collateral]]
