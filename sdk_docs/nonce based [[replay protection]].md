- A way to ensure that a given signature is useful only once.
- As used in [[Ethereum]] or other [[[[evm]] compatible chain]]s.
- Pros
    - Greatly simpler implementation than [[UTXO]] based chains.
- Cons
    - Transactions cannot be cancelled.
    - A high-urgency transaction can be "blocked by" a lower-urgency transaction with a lower nonce, with no safe way to ensure the order is adjusted.
- Alternatives
    - [[UTXO]]
    - [[multi-nonce]]
