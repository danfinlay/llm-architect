- Like edges in a graph
- Things that are like registries or naming authorities.
- The important thing is not the privilege, but recognizing hubs in the system of naming that multiple parties trust and rely on for many names.
- A hub is a node in a graph
    - The named entities are nodes emerging from that hub in the graph.
    - A user might have a [[pet name]] for the hub
    - The hub then has an [[edge name]] for a given item.
