- A fundamental scaling issue related to cross-ledger transactions that [[Egor Homakov]] has promoted as only solvable by [[credit line]].
    - In the opinion of [[Dan Finlay]], this associates the virtues of [[social collateral]] with the technical possibilities for scalability, which imply the most socially impactful construct (peer to peer [[credit line]]) could also be central to effective scaling. ie, [[credit line]] systems (like [[Circles UBI]] and [[Trustlines]], which struggle with scaling) can solve their scaling challenges by embracing cross-L2 transfers, and L2s can solve their cross-ledger liquidity problems by embracing peer to peer lines of credit.
        - This is not a new idea, of course.
