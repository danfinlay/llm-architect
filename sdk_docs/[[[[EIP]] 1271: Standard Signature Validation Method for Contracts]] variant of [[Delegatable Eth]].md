- Basic version [has been completed](https://github.com/delegatable/delegatable-sol/pull/34), could use more testing.
    - [[[[Gnosis]] SAFE]] testing
        - [sample 712 signature code in test](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/main/test/handlers/CompatibilityFallbackHandler.spec.ts#L86-L94)
            - Unclear why the two signatures are generated in such different ways.
- Necessary changes
    - Needs to call `isValidSignature` on the signer's contract instead of performing an `ecrecover`.
        - Formerly we would get the caller's address by performing an `ecrecover`, but if the signature is more an arbitrary proof-blob, we can't infer the caller's address from it. For that reason, we need another way to infer a signer's address.
        - Options
            - Update the type system
                - pros
                    - Better overall simplicity
                - cons
                    - Higher implementation burden
                - Add an `isContractAccount` field alongside any signature, and use that flag to trim an address off the beginning of the `signature` field.
                    - pros
                        - Gas efficient (trust the signer whether to ecrecover or not)
                        - Only adds a bit of data to the signed payload in the EOA case
                    - cons
                        - A little wonkier to use
                - Add a `senderAddress` field along any signature, and check it for `data` to determine whether it's a contract.
                    - pros
                        - Very easy to implement
                        - Very easy to use
                    - cons
                        - Higher gas cost (an SLOAD per signature!)
                - Add a `proof` field instead of a `signature`, and keep the `signature` and `isContractAccount` in it
                    - pros
                        - Semantically nicer
                    - cons
                        - Higher gas costs (each 721 struct adds hashing overhead on the evm)
            - Preserve existing types
                - Overload the `signature` field to embed a special format that includes the signer's address.
                    - pros
                        - Backwards compatible
                    - cons
                        - Harder to work with
                        - Harder to build
