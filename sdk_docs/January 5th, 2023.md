- A series of [[Crypto Punks]] thefts via [[[[OpenSea]] [[Wyvern Protocol]] phishing attack]]
    - I talked to [[YouMakinMeCrzy]] [here](https://twitter.com/YouMakinMeCrzy/status/1610853670752583680) last night, he’s interviewed these two victims. It seems they were both phished because they had [[Crypto Punks]] permitted to the old [[OpenSea]] contracts ([[[[Wyvern]] 1.3]]), so the confirmations used personal_sign in an unreadable way and had no red text, which they interpreted as making them safe. This is a tough situation!Should we show red text on **anything we can’t endorse as definitely safe**?? If we did, we’d probably really need to pick up the confirmation curation work, which would easily take another team to do well.personal_sign is the same one used by SIWE, so if we made it scarier, we’d make that experience scarier, unless it was paired with extra exceptions for them.Anyways, important topic, I wanted to highlight it.

- Kickstarter dao format for [[vacuum walled inflatable house]] concept
    - Alice has an idea: "I want to see this happen, but I only have X I could put up towards it, and I don't actually have the time or expertise to do it myself"
    - Alice states what she wants to do:
        - I'll put up $50k.
        - I'll put out a bid for people to offer to do it, select the contractors, and pay to have it done. I estimate it will take $350k base R&D, and I'm not sure what it will cost per unit.
            - and I'll hire two people for a year to try to build it, Let's imagine $150k/year, so $300k total in expenses, plus they obviously need supplies to try to build it, let's assume it might take at least $50k in materials to figure out a half basic prototype. So let's say $350k
        - I'll provide estimated unit costs as soon as I have them, and I'll continue adding information especially if we're looking close to hitting a funding goal.
    - Alice states the offer
        - I am now accepting bid in a modified [[MATT: An [[NFT]] Auction Concept]]
            - Bid the most you'd be willing to pay for one, delivered upon completion.
            - On closing the auction
                - No one will pay more than anyone else (base price)
                - For people requesting immediate delivery, the delivery cost was subtracted from their effective bid, and so their bid must be equal to the base price + delivery cost.
