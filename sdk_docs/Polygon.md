- An [[Ethereum]] [[layer 2]] network/[[scaling solution]]
- Is compatible with any [[evm]] [[smart contract]].
- Uses a quorum of validators to determine the next valid state.
    - This approach has been criticized for not requiring the enforcement of valid state transitions as is the case with an [[optimistic rollup (OR)]]. These critics sometimes insist this makes it not a true Layer 2, but instead something else, maybe a [[scaling solution]]
