- Takeaways
    - [[principal instances]] 
    - A site can hold multiple frames, frames can have multiple containers.
    - [[abstract syntax tree (AST)]] have desireable properties for a new browser.
        - Easy to inspect source code
        - Highly compressible
        - Fast to validate & optimize
        - Amenable to fine-grained code updates
        - Portable

    - A smaller API surface + caching can mean a more dynamic developer-space while still having good loading.
    - Uses a [[Syphon interpreter]] for its [[abstract syntax tree (AST)]]
    - APIs for browser scripts to interact with the browser ([time stamp](https://youtu.be/1uflg7LDmzI?t=1434))
        - create [[principal instances]] (url, embedOptions)
        - send Message (to another [[principal instances]]) (receivingUrl, msg)
        - listen (to other [[principal instances]]) (callback)
        - storage
            - put(key, val, isPublic)
            - get(key, isPublic)
        - Display
            - renderImg(bitmap)
            - `listenGUI((event)=>null)`
    - Easier to create "Deny by default" same origin policy security ([time stamp](https://youtu.be/1uflg7LDmzI?t=2354))
        - In a traditional browser, An origin has to give explicit permission for external entities to access resources.
        - Let's say a page has one subverted [[principal instances]]
            - It cannot tamper with resources belonging to other [[principal instances]], but if you assume other [[principal instances]] are reasonable, and don't just do arbitrary things when unexpected RPC messages show up, then nothing should be able to happen to those principal instances.
    - He uses `postMessage` for inter-site communication, and expects developers to enforce "no authority by default" for unauthenticated message connections.
    - Uses the same origin policy? To check on rewatch.
