- # MetaMask Share Proposal “B”
    - This document will outline a design for a type of fundraising and revenue distribution mechanism that could be used by any organization, but designed intended for use by the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet as currently funded by ConsenSys.
- ## The Goals
    - MetaMask aspires to be the wallet of the future: A low cost but highly useful utility that enables anyone to participate in crypto economies.
    - In order to be the most competitive wallet, we must both provide the best services, and maintain the leanest overhead possible. This has driven us to pursue a model that both allows a very open-ended type of fundraising with a clear path to profit for our investors, but also a clearly defined path for the MetaMask team to work towards employee-ownership if they are willing to commit to consistently reinvesting in the project themselves.
    - This work builds on and extends concepts from [continuous organizations](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/), but eschews the notion of a public market for shares, and instead prioritizes the team member’s ability to select their sources of funding, with the goals of selecting for alignment between investor and builder, and promoting employee diversification into the currencies that are useful to them.
- ## The Design
    - The token model has two cycles: A share issuance process, and a profit distribution process, serving as a source and sink for the network. We will discuss them in that order.
- ### Funding Acceptance and Share Issuance
    - First, initial shares will be distributed according to an approximation of “if these rules had existed for our history”.
    - Next, a MetaMask Mint contract will be created. It is run by the MetaMask team, who is able to tune a few parameters. For share issuance and funding acceptance, the relevant parameter is simply a registry of employees, and their designated pay rates.
    - Funders make an **offering** of funds available to the token mint (we may need to restrict those eligible to be legally compliant). Those funds are then available as payment to any employee designated by the MetaMask governance process, at their assigned **pay rate **(which is defined in a rate of shares). If these funds are accepted by a MetaMask employee as their pay, **shares** are minted for that funder in proportion to that payment, which can be split with the employee as part of the offer.

- ### Profit Distribution Process
    - When new profits are available, they will go through two phases to make them available to shareholders: A reverse dutch **auction**, and if not sold, a continuous market, or **buyback pool**.
    - The market will be initialized with some backing reserve funds, which will establish an immediate exchange rate for anyone who wants to redeem their shares for something more liquid.
- ### The Auction
    - The auction is currently a very rough draft, I’m pretty sure it doesn’t work as intended yet. It is intended to solve the issues related to abruptly adding funds to the buyback pool, where front-running becomes an important issue, and also to give funders the first opportunity to buy when the price is otherwise about to be affected.
    - Since an increased reserve pool will make the price increase by X, we want to ensure that if funders were hoping to sell for X, that they actually get to sell for the same price, and that the final sale price is the lowest one that they would all gladly sell at.
    - And now, probably flawed description:
    - New profits are put up for reverse dutch auction in exchange for shares. Their price will start high, and the offer price will drop continuously until either enough bids were made to buy all available shares, or it reaches the current market price, at which point the sale is concluded: Any offers are completed, and any remaining profits are added to the buyback pool’s reserve fund.
- ### The Buyback Pool
    - The MetaMask mint is also able to adjust the market’s **reserve ratio**, which can turn the buyback pool into a [bonding curve](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/) when set to anything other than 1. If MetaMask shareholders are stable, and not prone to immediate sales, reducing the reserve ratio can increase the amount offered to shareholders who are in need to liquidate for any reason.

- ### Advanced Options
    - Funders may make a single pool of funds available, or may use a subscription contract to make regular reinvestment automatic.
    - This mint contract could allow funders to make funds available to the MetaMask organization in an arbitrary currency with a proposed exchange rate function, allowing team members to accept the currencies that are most valuable to them.
    - When new profits are put up for auction, there may first be an auction made available exclusively to funders, in the style of “preferred stock”. This gives funders the first opportunity to take profit, but using this privilege also accelerates the organization towards employee ownership.
    - Rather than automatically generate shares in equal proportions, a funder’s offer can come with a proposed share split. This turns the share split into a sort of auction mechanic, and adds to the continuous negotiation between funders and employees, adding to the factors an employee must weigh when choosing a funder, and making funding more dynamic and potentially competitive, where the employees may get a lower cut when the expectation of returns is smaller, and incentivizes team members to help promote and demonstrate the likelihood of future revenue.
- ### Notes
    - Employees willing and able to post investments as funders to the team are able to both reduce the team’s burn rate and earn greater ownership in the team, so it rewards “only taking what you need for now”, and also can accelerate the path to employee-ownership.
    - Since funds made available can have arbitrary constraints, funders can potentially specify their own terms for fund redemption: They may dictate acceptable uses for the funds, acceptable recipients, or whatever else. The only thing that ultimately matters is that a MetaMask team member is willing to accept it as payment.
