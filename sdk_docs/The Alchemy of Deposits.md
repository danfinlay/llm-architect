    - Reads a bit like an explanation for why [[digital [[social collateral]]]] might have unappealing mental overhead, making it a great subject for this roam graph!
    - > There isn’t an ongoing exchange rate between Chase dollars and Bank of 
America dollars. Even attempting to imagine that invokes images of 
chaos. You’d have to specify a bank while doing a salary negotiation. 
Your rent might swing up or down based on the landlord’s judgment of 
your bank’s credit position.
        - I think there would be a simpler way to have floating values per business, to regain currency autonomy. I'm writing about it at [[Share Proposal C (better name pending)]]. If each person were paid in their company's shares, then a person would more care whether those shares were valued by anyone in an economic network connected to goods they value.
