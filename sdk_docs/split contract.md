            - Was the delivery on time?
        - Some cannot be
            - Was it good?
            - Was the result even a marketing study?

    - The stuff machines do
    - The comms between humans
    - The state of the interaction as the contract unfolds
    - Things go wrong, that's normal, most of real contracts are about edge cases.
    - Structured negotiation includes re-negotiation
    - Worst case, we have an audit trail that aids dispute mediation.
- Context is King
    - Reputation of provider (history, reviews)
    - Reputation of product
    - Warranties and guarantees
    - Ability to ask questions
