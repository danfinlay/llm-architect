- [[Airpod Pro]] from [[Apple]] has strong sound isolation and three modes:
    - Normal mode
    - Noise cancellation mode
        - Pulses of energy synchronized with incoming sound to negate them.
    - Transparent mode
        - Pulses of energy synchronized with incoming sound to facilitate them.
- My intuitions
    - Noise cancellation mode is likely the most power consumption.
