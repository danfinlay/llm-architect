    - [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/delegatable/delegatable-sol/tree/main/contracts/diamond)
    - Tests passing! May be workable!
    - I do not believe anyone is using it in production yet, so use with caution!
    - Caveats
        - Can only add delegation to other facets that integrate the [[the _msgSender() trick]] [as I did for my custom Delegatable LibDiamond here](https://github.com/delegatable/delegatable-sol/blob/add-diamond-facet/contracts/diamond/libraries/LibDiamond.sol#L356).
